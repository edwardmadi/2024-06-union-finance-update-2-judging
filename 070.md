# getLoanableAmount will return value lesser than the actual tokens available in all the pool if the token is supported by aave

## Summary

The `getLoanableAmount` function in `AssetManager.sol` returns a value less than the actual tokens available in the pool if the token is supported by Aave. This discrepancy arises because the interest earned in the Aave pool through the minting of interest-bearing tokens (aTokens) is not accounted for properly. Consequently, the reported loanable amount and pool balance may be lower than the true available amount, leading to potential function reverts and missed borrowing opportunities.

## Vulnerability Detail

Look at the implementation in the Aave pool - https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/b74526a7bc67a3a117a1963fc871b3eb8cea8435/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/SupplyLogic.sol#L118-L120. 

The `getLoanableAmount` function relies on the `getPoolBalance` function to determine the total pool balance. However, for tokens supported by Aave, the `totalSupplyView` method returns the number of aTokens in the pool, which does not account for the interest accrued on these tokens. As a result, the pool balance appears lower than it actually is.

according to the developer's comment we are to return ( "Get total supply of this Contracts including any balance that has been deposited into the underlying market") the total amount of atoken plus the acquired interest based on the liquidityindex  change

### Problematic Code Snippets

In `AssetManager.sol`:

```solidity
function getPoolBalance(address tokenAddress) public view override returns (uint256) {
    IERC20Upgradeable poolToken = IERC20Upgradeable(tokenAddress);
    uint256 balance = poolToken.balanceOf(address(this));
    if (isMarketSupported(tokenAddress)) {

 @AUDIT>> Lesser token value returned for aave>>       return totalSupplyView(tokenAddress) + balance;

    } else {
        return balance;
    }
}

function getLoanableAmount(address tokenAddress) public view override returns (uint256) {
    uint256 poolBalance = getPoolBalance(tokenAddress);
    return poolBalance > totalPrincipal[tokenAddress] ? poolBalance - totalPrincipal[tokenAddress] : 0;
}
```

In `AaveV3Adapter.sol`:

```solidity

   @audit>> read>>    /*** @dev Get total supply of this Contracts including any balance that has been
     * deposited into the underlying market
     * @param tokenAddress The token to check supply for
     */
function getSupplyView(address tokenAddress) external view override returns (uint256) {
  @audit>> only atoken balance retrieve not including any other balance that has been deposited into the underlying market >>    return _getSupply(tokenAddress);
}

function getRate(address tokenAddress) external view override returns (uint256) {
    LendingPool3.ReserveData memory reserveData = lendingPool.getReserveData(tokenAddress);
    return uint256(reserveData.currentLiquidityRate);
}
```


## Impact

The impact of this vulnerability includes:
1. **Withdraw Function Reverting**: The `withdraw` function in `AssetManager` may revert even when sufficient funds are available.
```solidity
 function withdraw(
        address token,
        address account,
        uint256 amount
    ) external override whenNotPaused nonReentrant onlyAuth(token) returns (uint256) {
        if (!_checkSenderBalance(msg.sender, token, amount)) revert InsufficientBalance();

  function _checkSenderBalance(address sender, address tokenAddress, uint256 amount) private view returns (bool) {
        if (_isUToken(sender, tokenAddress)) {
            // For all the lending markets, which have no deposits, return the tokens from the pool
    @audit>> cause revert>>           return getLoanableAmount(tokenAddress) >= amount;
        }

        return balances[sender][tokenAddress] >= amount;
    }
```
2. **Borrow Function Reverting**: The `borrow` function in `UToken.sol` may also revert despite adequate funds, resulting in missed borrowing opportunities and loss of potential rewards for the protocol.
```solidity
 function borrow(address to, uint256 amount) external override onlyMember(msg.sender) whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
        IAssetManager assetManagerContract = IAssetManager(assetManager);
        uint256 actualAmount = decimalScaling(amount, underlyingDecimal);
        if (actualAmount < _minBorrow) revert AmountLessMinBorrow();

        // Calculate the origination fee
        uint256 fee = calculatingFee(actualAmount);

        if (_borrowBalanceView(msg.sender) + actualAmount + fee > _maxBorrow) revert AmountExceedMaxBorrow();
        if (checkIsOverdue(msg.sender)) revert MemberIsOverdue();
   @audit>> cause revert>>       if (amount > assetManagerContract.getLoanableAmount(underlying)) revert InsufficientFundsLeft();
      ....................................................
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To mitigate this issue, include the total interest acquired in the pool when calculating the total supply. This can be achieved by introducing a new function to obtain interest in the pool and adjusting the `getSupplyView` function accordingly.

### Updated Code Snippets

In `AaveAdapter.sol`, add a new function to get the interest in the pool:

```solidity
function getInterest(address tokenAddress) public view returns (uint256) {
    LendingPool3.ReserveData memory reserveData = lendingPool.getReserveData(tokenAddress);
...................................
   /// calculate interest here

    return interest;
}

function getSupplyView(address tokenAddress) external view override returns (uint256) {
    return _getSupply(tokenAddress) + getInterest(tokenAddress);
}
```
