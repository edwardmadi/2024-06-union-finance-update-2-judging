# Improper Initialization Function Implementation

## Summary
The contract lacks a proper public initialization function, which is crucial for upgradeable contracts. This could lead to initialization failures or potential re-initialization attacks.

## Vulnerability Detail
The contract implements an internal __Controller_init function, but there's no public initialize function that calls this internal function. Additionally, the initializer modifier is missing, which is essential to prevent multiple initializations.

## Impact
The contract cannot be properly initialized through the proxy.
There's a risk of the contract being uninitialized or improperly initialized, leading to unexpected behavior.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function __Controller_init(address admin_) internal onlyInitializing {
    _paused = false;
    admin = admin_;
    __UUPSUpgradeable_init();
    pauseGuardian = admin_;
}
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a public initialize function that calls the internal `__Controller_init` function and use the initializer modifier:

```solidity
function initialize(address admin_) public initializer {
    __Controller_init(admin_);
}
```
