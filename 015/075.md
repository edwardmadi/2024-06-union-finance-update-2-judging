# Unprotected UUPSUpgradeable Initialization

## Summary
The `__UUPSUpgradeable_init()` function is called within the `__Controller_init` function without proper protection against multiple initializations.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `__UUPSUpgradeable_init()` function is called in the `__Controller_init` function, but there's no guarantee that this won't be called multiple times since the initializer modifier is missing on any public initialization function.

## Impact
Potential for multiple initializations of the `UUPSUpgradeable` functionality.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function __Controller_init(address admin_) internal onlyInitializing {
    _paused = false;
    admin = admin_;
    __UUPSUpgradeable_init();
    pauseGuardian = admin_;
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Ensure that the __UUPSUpgradeable_init() function is called only once by implementing a public initialize function with the initializer modifier:

```solidity
function initialize(address admin_) public initializer {
    __Controller_init(admin_);
}

function __Controller_init(address admin_) internal initializer {
    _paused = false;
    admin = admin_;
    __UUPSUpgradeable_init();
    pauseGuardian = admin_;
}
```
This ensures that the entire initialization process, including the UUPSUpgradeable initialization, can only occur once.
