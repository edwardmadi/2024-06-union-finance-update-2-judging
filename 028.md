# The division overflow in `ScaledDecimalBase.sol` may cause user losing their funds

### Summary

The division overflow in `ScaledDecimalBase.sol`::`decimalReducing()` may cause user losing their funds, because when user deposit token with small decimal such as USDC, the actual amount return may be 0

### Root Cause

In `ScaledDecimalBase.sol:19` there is a `decimalReducing()` function, the problem is if alice deposit 1000USDC, the `actualAmount` will be 1000*10^6, the decimal is 6, because 6 < 18, the actual amount return by the function is 1000*10^6 / 10 ** 12, because 1000*10^6 < 10 ** 12, so the result will be 0 thanks to solidity rounding feature.In fact, any amount less then 1000000USDC will become 0. 

### Internal pre-conditions

1.if the function ever deal with the scenario I mentioned before, there could be a problem.  

### External pre-conditions

1.Since the function is widely used, any action user have done related to the function will be affected
