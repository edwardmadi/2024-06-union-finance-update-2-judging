# UToken failed to consider temporary depegging of USDC, USDT, DAI

## Summary
The UToken Borrow contracts assume that the ratio of USD: USDC is 1:1, hence no oracle was used.

## Vulnerability Detail
A user can take advantage of a temporary depeg of say 1 : 0.97, to borrow large enough tokens and pay back the borrowed tokens when depeg is rebalanced say 1: 0.99, 0.02 * 10000, is 200 USD value lost due to bad debt

## Impact
Loss of funds, bad debt
