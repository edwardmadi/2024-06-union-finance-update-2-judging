# Lack of Reentrancy Guard in Functions with Transfer Hooks

## File Location
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-union-finance-update-2/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/user/UserManagerOp.sol#L19

## Summary
The _'registerMember'_ function does not have a reentrancy guard when calling contracts/addresses with transfer hooks. This opens up the possibility of read-only reentrance that could be exploited by unknown or untrusted ERC20 tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
On line 19, there is a _'safeTransferFrom'_ call from the ERC20 contract to the _'comptroller'_ address without using reentrancy guard. This call allows for read-only reentrance if the token used has transfer hooks that can call back functions in the contract before execution completes.

## Impact
- State inconsistencies in contracts
- Further transaction failure
- financial loss
- damage to the integrity of the protocol as a whole

## Code Snippet
L19
`        IERC20Upgradeable(unionToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(comptroller), newMemberFee);`

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add reentrancy guard to the _'registerMember'_ function to protect against read-only reentrancy attacks. Use the _'nonReentrant'_ modifier of OpenZeppelin ReentrancyGuard to ensure that no functions in the contract can be re-called before execution has completed.
1. Add import ReentrancyGuard from OpenZeppelin:
`import "@openzeppelin/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol";
`
2. Inherit a contract from ReentrancyGuard:
```solidity
contract UserManagerOp is ReentrancyGuard {
    // contents of the contract
}
```
3. Add the 'nonReentrant' modifier to the 'registerMember' function:
```solidity
function registerMember(...) external nonReentrant {
    // fill function
}
```
