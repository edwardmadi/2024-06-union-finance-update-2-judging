# Implementation of a Two-Step Procedure to Update Protocol Addresses

## File Location
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-union-finance-update-2/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/user/UserManager.sol#L378

## Summary
The lack of a two-step procedure for critical operations can lead to error proneness.

## Vulnerability Detail
On line 378, there is a _'setUToken'_ function that can be used to update the uToken address with admin access. This function allows immediate changes without a two-step procedure, which can increase the risk of errors or unintentional changes.

## Impact
- Accidental or malicious change of protocol address.
- Administrative errors that can result in major losses or service interruptions.
- Increased security risks due to poorly verified changes.

## Code Snippet
L378
`    function setUToken(address uToken_) external onlyAdmin {`

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To reduce the risk, it is recommended to implement a two-step procedure on critical functions such as _'setUToken'_.
Here is an example of a modification to add a two-step procedure to the _'setUToken'_ function:
```solidity
// Add state variables to store the proposed address and confirmation time
address public proposedUToken;
uint256 public proposedTime;

// Function to propose a new uToken address
function proposeUToken(address uToken_) external onlyAdmin {
    proposedUToken = uToken_;
    proposedTime = block.timestamp;
}

// Function to confirm uToken address change after a certain period of time
function confirmUToken() external onlyAdmin {
    require(proposedUToken != address(0), "No uToken proposed");
    require(block.timestamp >= proposedTime + 1 days, "Confirmation period not yet passed");
    uToken = proposedUToken;
    proposedUToken = address(0);
}
```
