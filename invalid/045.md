# Incorrect Interface Used for ERC20 Bridging in `OpConnector` Contract

## Summary
The `OpConnector` contract uses the `IL1StandardBridge` interface for ERC20 token bridging, which is incorrect. The correct interface to use for ERC20 bridging is `IL1ERC20Bridge`.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `OpConnector` contract imports and uses the `IL1StandardBridge` interface, which is intended for bridging ETH. However, for ERC20 token bridging, the `IL1ERC20Bridge` interface should be used instead. This discrepancy can lead to improper function calls and potential execution failures.

```solidity
File: union-v2-contracts/contracts/token/OpConnector.sol:

   7: import {IL1StandardBridge} from "@eth-optimism/contracts/L1/messaging/IL1StandardBridge.sol"; // @audit use IL1ERC20Bridge instead of IL1StandardBridge
   8  

  38          }
  39:         IL1StandardBridge(l1BridgeAddr).depositERC20To(
  40              l1Token,
```

## Impact
Using the wrong interface can cause the contract to malfunction during the bridging process. This could result in failed transactions, or inability to bridge tokens as intended.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Replace the import of `IL1StandardBridge` with `IL1ERC20Bridge` and update the function calls accordingly to ensure proper bridging of ERC20 tokens.
