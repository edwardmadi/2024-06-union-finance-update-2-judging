# `Comptroller::withdraw` function can be called by non-owner which leads to fund to get withdrawn without the owner intention

### Summary

The `withdrawRewards` funciton is intended to withdraw rewards when the caller calls this function with the address and `token` as input. However, it fails to check whether the account given as input is the caller or any arbitary account. Which can potentially leads to protocol to withdraw amount for an address which is not expecting to receive their rewards.

### Root Cause

Root cause of this vulnerability is the missing check whether the caller is the same address whose token is being withdrawn

### Mitigation

I recommend the following changes:

```solidity 
function withdrawRewards(address account, address token) external override whenNotPaused returns (uint256) {  
        uint256 amount = _accrueRewards(account, token);
        require(account == msg.sender, "Arbitary account");
        if (amount > 0 && unionToken.balanceOf(address(this)) >= amount) {
            users[account][token].accrued = 0;
            unionToken.safeTransfer(account, amount);
            emit LogWithdrawRewards(account, amount);

            return amount;
        } else {
            users[account][token].accrued = amount;
            emit LogWithdrawRewards(account, 0);

            return 0;
        }
    }
    ```
