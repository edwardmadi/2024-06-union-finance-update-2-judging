# A new staker cannot be registered as member, preventing him from giving credits

### Summary

There's a flaw in the user registration process. New stakers can't register as member, because the system expects them to already have vouches, which is impossible for a completely new staker. As a result, new stakers can't participate in giving credits, breaking a core contract functionality.

### Root Cause

The design of the  [`_validateNewMember()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-union-finance-update-2/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/user/UserManager.sol#L1140) function in [`UserManager.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-union-finance-update-2/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/user/UserManager.sol) is flawed, creating a barrier for new stakers to become members, preventing him from giving credits, breaking a core contract functionality.

The key issues are:

- The function relies on existing vouches to validate new members.
- New users always have zero vouches, as the _vouchers mapping is not updated by staking alone.
- The function always reverts for new users due to `count` remaining at 0, failing the `effectiveCount` check.

This creates a circular dependency: users need vouches to become members, but they can't receive vouches without first being members.

For a more detailed explanation of the flow check the **Attack Path** section.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Admin needs to set `effectiveCount_` to be > 0 in the [`__UserManager_init`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-union-finance-update-2/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/user/UserManager.sol#L321)

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

Following the [official documentation's "becoming a member" path](https://docs.union.finance/user-guides/becoming-a-member) the attack path is as follows:

1. User stakes some amount of USDC tokens succesfully through [`UserManager::stake()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-union-finance-update-2/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/user/UserManager.sol#L738) intending to start crediting after that.

2. To give credits, the user must become a registered member, as [`UserManager::updateTrust()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-union-finance-update-2/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/user/UserManager.sol#L586) is restricted to onlyMember's:
```solidity
function updateTrust(address borrower, uint96 trustAmount) external onlyMember(msg.sender) whenNotPaused {
```

3. The staker calls [`UserManager::registerMember()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-union-finance-update-2/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/user/UserManager.sol#L722) to register as a member which invokes [`UserManager::_validateNewMember()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-union-finance-update-2/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/user/UserManager.sol#L1140)

4. [`UserManager::_validateNewMember()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-union-finance-update-2/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/user/UserManager.sol#L1140) fails for the new staker due to the function's flow:

 -  The `count` variable is initialized to 0:
```solidity
uint256 count = 0; 
```

 -  The `vouchersLength` variable is set to the length of `_vouchers[newMember]`, which is always 0 for new users:

Note:
>As the _vouchers mapping is not updated when a user only stakes, as staking alone doesn't create vouchers. Vouchers are created through the `UserManager::updateTrust()` function, which requires the staker to already be a member.

```solidity
uint256 vouchersLength = _vouchers[newMember].length;
```

 -  Due to `vouchersLength` being 0, the for loop that should increment the count is never entered, as a result, `count` remains 0:
```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < vouchersLength; i++) { //@audit vouchersLength is 0
            vouch = _vouchers[newMember][i];
            staker = _stakers[vouch.staker];
            if (staker.stakedAmount > 0) count++;
            if (count >= effectiveCount) break;
        }
```

 -  The function checks `if (count < effectiveCount)`. Since `effectiveCount` is set by the admin to a value > 0 during contract initialization, and `count` is 0, this condition will be true. This triggers a revert with the NotEnoughStakers() error:
```solidity
 if (count < effectiveCount) revert NotEnoughStakers();
```

This implementation creates an impossible condition for new stakers: they need vouches to become members, but they can't receive vouches without first being members. Consequently, new stakers are prevented from giving credits as they cannot be registered as members.

### Impact

The flaw in the user registration process prevents new stakers from becoming members. This, in turn, prevents them from participating in a core function of the contract: giving credits.

### PoC

1. Modify [`TestUserManagerBase.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-union-finance-update-2/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/test/foundry/userManager/TestUserManagerBase.sol) as follows:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import {TestWrapper} from "../TestWrapper.sol";
import {UserManager} from "union-v2-contracts/user/UserManager.sol";
import {AssetManagerMock} from "union-v2-contracts/mocks/AssetManagerMock.sol";
import {UnionTokenMock} from "union-v2-contracts/mocks/UnionTokenMock.sol";
import {FaucetERC20} from "union-v2-contracts/mocks/FaucetERC20.sol";
import {ComptrollerMock} from "union-v2-contracts/mocks/ComptrollerMock.sol";
import {UTokenMock} from "union-v2-contracts/mocks/UTokenMock.sol";
import {UserManagerOp} from "union-v2-contracts/user/UserManagerOp.sol";

contract TestUserManagerBase is TestWrapper {
    UserManager public userManager;
    UserManagerOp public userManagerOp;

    address public constant ADMIN = address(1);
    address public constant MEMBER = address(2);
    address public constant ACCOUNT = address(3);
    address public constant SIMO = address(4);
    uint256 public constant maxOverdue = 1000;
    uint256 public constant effectiveCount = 3;
    uint256 public constant maxVouchers = 500;
    uint256 public constant maxVouchees = 1000;

    function setUp() public virtual {
        address userManagerLogic = address(new UserManager());
        address userManagerOpLogic = address(new UserManagerOp());

        deployMocks();

        userManager = UserManager(
            deployProxy(
                userManagerLogic,
                abi.encodeWithSignature(
                    "__UserManager_init(address,address,address,address,address,uint256,uint256,uint256,uint256)",
                    address(assetManagerMock),
                    address(unionTokenMock),
                    address(erc20Mock),
                    address(comptrollerMock),
                    ADMIN,
                    maxOverdue,
                    effectiveCount,
                    maxVouchers,
                    maxVouchees
                )
            )
        );

        userManagerOp = UserManagerOp(
            deployProxy(
                userManagerOpLogic,
                abi.encodeWithSignature(
                    "__UserManager_init(address,address,address,address,address,uint256,uint256,uint256,uint256)",
                    address(assetManagerMock),
                    address(unionTokenMock),
                    address(erc20Mock),
                    address(comptrollerMock),
                    ADMIN,
                    maxOverdue,
                    effectiveCount,
                    maxVouchers,
                    maxVouchees
                )
            )
        );

        vm.startPrank(ADMIN);
        userManager.setUToken(address(uTokenMock));
        userManager.addMember(MEMBER);
        userManagerOp.setUToken(address(uTokenMock));
        userManagerOp.addMember(MEMBER);
        vm.stopPrank();

        erc20Mock.mint(MEMBER, 100 ether);
        erc20Mock.mint(SIMO, 100 ether);
        erc20Mock.mint(address(this), 100 ether);

        erc20Mock.approve(address(userManager), type(uint256).max);

        vm.startPrank(MEMBER);
        erc20Mock.approve(address(userManager), type(uint256).max);
        erc20Mock.approve(address(userManagerOp), type(uint256).max);
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.startPrank(SIMO);
        erc20Mock.approve(address(userManager), type(uint256).max);
        erc20Mock.approve(address(userManagerOp), type(uint256).max);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
}

```

2. Add to the [`TestRegister.t.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-union-finance-update-2/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/test/foundry/userManager/TestRegister.t.sol) contract the following test: 

```solidity
function testNewStakerCannotRegister() public {
        vm.startPrank(ADMIN);
        uint256 newMemberFee = userManager.newMemberFee();
        unionTokenMock.mint(SIMO, newMemberFee);
        userManager.setEffectiveCount(1);
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.startPrank(SIMO);
        unionTokenMock.approve(address(userManager), newMemberFee);

        userManager.stake((2 * UNIT).toUint96());

        vm.expectRevert(UserManager.NotEnoughStakers.selector);
        userManager.registerMember(SIMO);

        vm.expectRevert(UserManager.AuthFailed.selector);
        userManager.updateTrust(ACCOUNT, (1 * UNIT).toUint96());

        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```

Run the test with the command: `forge test --match-test testNewStakerCannotRegister -vvvv`

### Mitigation

Instead of relying on existing vouches, the  [`UserManager::_validateNewMember()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-union-finance-update-2/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/user/UserManager.sol#L1140) function could consider alternative ways to validate new members. Since I'm unsure of the best implementation approach, I'd prefer to refrain from recommending specific code
