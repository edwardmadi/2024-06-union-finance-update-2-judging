# Missing accrueInterest() Update Lead to inaccurate New Borrow index calculation

## Summary
Borrow Index are not updated before the Borrow rate is changed by admin leading to inconsistencies in accrued rewards.

## Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerability arises from the lack of accrual of interest before changing the interest rate model in the `setInterestRateModel` function. In its current implementation, the function directly sets the new interest rate model without updating the borrow index, leading to inconsistencies in accrued rewards. 

Here is the current implementation of the function:

 ```solidity
  /**
     *  @dev Change to a different interest rate model
     *  Accept claims only from the admin
     *  @param newInterestRateModel_ New interest rate model address
     */
    function setInterestRateModel(address newInterestRateModel_) external override onlyAdmin {
        address oldInterestRateModel = address(interestRateModel);
        address newInterestRateModel = newInterestRateModel_;
        interestRateModel = IInterestRateModel(newInterestRateModel);
        emit LogNewMarketInterestRateModel(oldInterestRateModel, newInterestRateModel);
    }
```

## Impact

When the interest rate model is changed without updating the borrow index, the accrued interest is not properly accounted for. This can result in users either losing their accrued interest or being charged more than they should be, depending on whether the new interest rate is lower or higher than the old rate leading to Inconsistency in Borrow index because of the change in borrowrate of the entire protocol.


This issue has been identified in previous audits as well:

1. [Munchables Findings Issue #20](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-05-munchables-findings/issues/20)
2. [Revert Lend Findings Issue #400](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-revert-lend-findings/issues/400)

These references highlight the importance of updating indices before making changes to interest rates or other critical parameters to ensure accurate and fair interest calculations.

## Recommendation

Update Borrow index before changing the borrow Rate

```solidity

  function setInterestRateModel(address newInterestRateModel_) external override onlyAdmin {

        address oldInterestRateModel = address(interestRateModel);

++   if (!accrueInterest()) revert AccrueInterestFailed();

        address newInterestRateModel = newInterestRateModel_;
        interestRateModel = IInterestRateModel(newInterestRateModel);
        emit LogNewMarketInterestRateModel(oldInterestRateModel, newInterestRateModel);
    }

```
