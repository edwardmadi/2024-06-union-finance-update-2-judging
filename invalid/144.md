# I-01 : Lacks of proper checks in `AssetManager :: withdraw` function makes the function more gas expensive.

### Summary

The `withdraw` function in the `AssetManager.sol` contract manages token withdrawals. It first checks if the requested amount is available in the asset manager. If it is, the amount is taken from there. If not, it tries to get the remaining amount from the money market. If there's still not enough, it updates the state with whatever amount it was able to get for the requested account. To make this process more efficient, it would be better to check if there's a remaining amount before taking any from the money market and updating the state.

### Mitigation

I recommend to implement the following changes:

```diff
 function withdraw(
        address token,
        address account,
        uint256 amount
    ) external override whenNotPaused nonReentrant onlyAuth(token) returns (uint256) {
        if (!_checkSenderBalance(msg.sender, token, amount)) revert InsufficientBalance();

        uint256 remaining = amount;

        // If there are tokens in Asset Manager then transfer them on priority
        uint256 selfBalance = IERC20Upgradeable(token).balanceOf(address(this));
        if (selfBalance > 0) {
            uint256 withdrawAmount = selfBalance < remaining ? selfBalance : remaining;
            remaining -= withdrawAmount;
            IERC20Upgradeable(token).safeTransfer(account, withdrawAmount);
        }

-        if (isMarketSupported(token)) {
+        if (isMarketSupported(token) && remaining >0) {
            uint256 withdrawSeqLength = withdrawSeq.length;
            // iterate markets according to defined sequence and withdraw
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < withdrawSeqLength && remaining > 0; i++) {
                IMoneyMarketAdapter moneyMarket = withdrawSeq[i];
                if (!moneyMarket.supportsToken(token)) continue;

                uint256 supply = moneyMarket.getSupply(token);
                if (supply == 0) continue;

                uint256 withdrawAmount = supply < remaining ? supply : remaining;
                if (moneyMarket.withdraw(token, account, withdrawAmount)) {
                    remaining -= withdrawAmount;
                }
            }
        }

-        if (!_isUToken(msg.sender, token)) {
+        if (!_isUToken(msg.sender, token) && remaining >0 ) {
            balances[msg.sender][token] = balances[msg.sender][token] - amount + remaining;
            totalPrincipal[token] = totalPrincipal[token] - amount + remaining;
        }

        emit LogWithdraw(token, account, amount, remaining);

        return remaining;
    }
    
```
