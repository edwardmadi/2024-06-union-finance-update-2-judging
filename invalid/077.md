# Missing storage gap

## Summary
Contract [UToken](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-union-finance-update-2/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/market/UToken.sol#L26) is upgradable and it act like base contract, but it doesnt have a storage gap.
## Vulnerability Detail
If the contract inheriting the base contract contains additional variable, then the base contract cannot be upgraded to include any additional variable, because it would overwrite the variable declared in its child contract. This greatly limits contract upgradeability.
