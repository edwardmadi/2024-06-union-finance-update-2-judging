# Lack of Zero Address Check in setAssetManager Function will Allows Denial of Service Attack

## Summary
The lack of a zero address check in the `setAssetManager `function of the contract will cause a denial of service attack for `stakers` as an attacker can set the `assetManager` address to zero, effectively disabling the contract's functionality.


## Vulnerability Detail
In AaveV3Adapter.sol:115, there is a missing check on the `_assetManager` parameter of the `setAssetManager` function to ensure that it is not set to the zero address `(address(0))`.
## Impact

The `users` cannot perform any actions, effectively locking their funds in the contract. The attacker does not gain any direct benefit but can cause significant inconvenience and disruption to the protocol's users.

```solidity
  /**
     * @dev Set the asset manager contract address
     * @dev Only callable by the admin
     * @param _assetManager AssetManager contract address
     */
    function setAssetManager(address _assetManager) external onlyAdmin {
        assetManager = _assetManager;
        emit LogSetAssetManager(msg.sender, _assetManager);
    }


```
POC
```solidity

    function testSetAssetManager() public {
        vm.prank(ADMIN);
        adapter.setAssetManager(address(0));
      
    }
```
Result: It doesn't revert.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this vulnerability, add a check to ensure that _assetManager is not set to address(0) in the setAssetManager function:
```solidity

/**
 * @dev Set the asset manager contract address
 * @dev Only callable by the admin
 * @param _assetManager AssetManager contract address
 */
function setAssetManager(address _assetManager) external onlyAdmin {
    require(_assetManager != address(0), "AssetManager cannot be zero address");
    assetManager = _assetManager;
    emit LogSetAssetManager(msg.sender, _assetManager);
}
```
