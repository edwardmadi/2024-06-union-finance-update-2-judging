## Summary
There are two for loops that make external calls at lines 144 and 418. External calls in infinite loops can cause Denial of Service (DoS) problems if there are too many iterations performed, because each iteration requires a significant amount of gas.

## Vulnerability Detail
The loop makes external calls in its iterations, such as _'IMoneyMarketAdapter(newSeq[i])'_ and _'moneyMarkets[i].supportsToken(tokenAddress)'_. If the length of _'newSeq'_ or _'moneyMarkets'_ is very large, then the contract could run out of gas before the loop completes, causing the transaction to fail and potentially causing a DoS.

## Impact
- Denial of Service (DoS)
- High Gas Fees

## Code Snippet
L144
`        for (uint i = 0; i < newSeq.length; i++) {`
L418
`            for (uint256 i = 0; i < moneyMarkets.length; i++) {`

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. Limit the Number of Iterations
2. Use Batch Techniques
3. Input Validation
Example solution to limit iterations:
```solidity
uint256 maxIterations = 100; // maximum iteration limit
uint256 iterations = newSeq.length < maxIterations ? newSeq.length : maxIterations;
for (uint i = 0; i < iterations; i++) {
    // Implementasi loop
}
```
