# In `_vouchFor(from)` function, there is no validation for `from`.;

## Summary
In `_vouchFor(from)` function, there is no validation for `from`.;

## Vulnerability Detail
When onERC1155Received, onERC1155BatchReceived is called, from is not checked.
In particular, `_vouchFor` function calls `IUserManager(USER_MANAGER).updateTrust(acc, uint96(trustAmount));`

In `UserMnager.sol` 's `updateTrust` function, `address borrower` is very important part including array's index.

## Impact
If an incorrect address or value is entered, a fatal error will occur in all operations.
