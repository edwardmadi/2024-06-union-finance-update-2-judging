# FUNCTIONS CAN BE BROKEN WHEN USING TOKENS THAT DO NOT FOLLOW THE ERC2612 STANDARD

## Summary
function  invokes `permit()` and continue that the operation is successful without  verifying the outcome.
## Vulnerability Detail
For example, the `DAI` Stablecoin utilizes a `permit()` function that deviates from the reference
implementation. This lack of verification may lead to inconsistencies
and unexpected behavior when interacting with non-conforming tokens

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add proper verification to the `permit()` function call. After calling
the `permit()` function, ensure that the operation was successful before
proceeding with the repay borrow process
