# Missing Zero Address Check in addToken  and addAdapter Function

## Summary
The `addToken ` and `addAdapter` function in the `AssetManager `contract allows an administrator to add a new ERC20  token and new `adapter` to the supported list. However, the function does not check if the `tokenAddress ` and `adapter` parameter is the zero address (0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000). Adding the zero address as a supported token can lead to various issues and potentially disrupt the contract's functionality.
## Vulnerability Detail

The `addToken `function does not include a check to ensure that the provided `tokenAddress ` is not the zero address. If an administrator inadvertently or maliciously adds the zero address, it would result in an invalid token being added to the list of supported tokens. This can cause several problems:

## Impact
The zero address in the list of supported tokens can cause disruptions and errors in other parts of the contract, potentially leading to a denial of service.

```solidity
/** 
 *  @dev Add a new ERC20 token to support in AssetManager 
 *  @param tokenAddress ERC20 token address 
 */ 
function addToken(address tokenAddress) external override onlyAdmin {
    if (supportedMarkets[tokenAddress]) revert TokenExists();
    supportedTokensList.push(tokenAddress);
    supportedMarkets[tokenAddress] = true;

    approveAllMarketsMax(tokenAddress);
}



 /**
     *  @dev Add a new adapter for the underlying lending protocol
     *  @param adapterAddress adapter address
     */
    function addAdapter(address adapterAddress) external override onlyAdmin {// can be zero @bug
        bool isExist = false;
        uint256 moneyMarketsLength = moneyMarkets.length;

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < moneyMarketsLength; i++) {
            if (adapterAddress == address(moneyMarkets[i])) isExist = true;
        }

        if (!isExist) {
            moneyMarkets.push(IMoneyMarketAdapter(adapterAddress));
            withdrawSeq.push(IMoneyMarketAdapter(adapterAddress));
        }

        approveAllTokensMax(adapterAddress);
    }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a check to ensure that the tokenAddress is not the zero address before proceeding with the rest of the function. The updated code should look like this:
```solidity
/** 
 *  @dev Add a new ERC20 token to support in AssetManager 
 *  @param tokenAddress ERC20 token address 
 */ 
function addToken(address tokenAddress) external override onlyAdmin {
    if (tokenAddress == address(0)) revert InvalidTokenAddress(); // Add this check
    if (supportedMarkets[tokenAddress]) revert TokenExists();
    supportedTokensList.push(tokenAddress);
    supportedMarkets[tokenAddress] = true;

    approveAllMarketsMax(tokenAddress);
}

```
