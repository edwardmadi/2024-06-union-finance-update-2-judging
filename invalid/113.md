# `onERC1155Received` and `onERC1155BatchReceived` Not Considering `value`, `values` and `ids` Parameters while performing ERC1155 deposits

## Summary
The `ERC1155Voucher` contract's `onERC1155Received` and `onERC1155BatchReceived` functions do not consider the `value`, `values` and `ids` parameters when vouching, resulting in the same trust amount being given regardless of the quantity or number of tokens deposited.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `ERC1155Voucher` contract, the `onERC1155Received` and `onERC1155BatchReceived` functions call the `_vouchFor` function to update the user's trust amount. However, these functions do not consider the  `value`, `values` and `ids` parameter, which represents the quantity of tokens being transferred. As a result, the trust amount remains the same irrespective of the number of tokens or the quantity of tokens deposited.

## Impact
This oversight can lead to an unfair distribution of trust, where users receive the same amount of trust regardless of the actual value of their deposit. This can be exploited by depositing minimal quantities to gain maximum trust, undermining the integrity of the vouching system.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To ensure fair distribution of trust, the `onERC1155Received` and `onERC1155BatchReceived` functions should consider the `values` parameter when vouching. Additionally, the `onERC1155BatchReceived` function should account for the number of different tokens (`ids`) being deposited.
