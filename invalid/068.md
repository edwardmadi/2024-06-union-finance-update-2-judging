# Arbitrary `from` passed to `transferFrom` (or `safeTransferFrom`)

# Summary
Passing an arbitrary `from` address (`payer` in this case) to `transferFrom` (or `safeTransferFrom`) can lead to loss of funds, because anyone can transfer tokens from the `from` address if an approval is made.  

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-union-finance-update-2/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/market/UToken.sol#L761

The code allows the from address (`payer` in this case) to be specified arbitrarily when calling `safeTransferFrom`. This means that as long as the specified from address has approved the caller or contract, tokens can be transferred without further validation.

# Vulnerability Detail

Please consider the below example to understand this bug:

1. The user (address 0xUserAddress) grants approval to a contract (address 0xContractAddress) to transfer up to 100 tokens on their behalf.  
   
```solidity
IERC20Upgradeable(underlyingToken).approve(0xContractAddress, 100);
```

2. The contract has a function that calls `safeTransferFrom` to transfer tokens from an arbitrary from address (in this case, the approved user's address) to the contract's address.  

```solidity
function transferFromUser(address payer, uint256 amount) public {
        token.safeTransferFrom(payer, address(this), amount);
    }
```
In the above `transferFromUser` function takes a payer address and an amount and transfers tokens from the payer to the contract's address.

3. A bad actor calls the `transferFromUser` function, specifying the user's address (`0xUserAddress`) as the payer and an arbitrary amount (just as example `50` tokens).

```solidity
VulnerableContract vulnerable = VulnerableContract(0xContractAddress);
vulnerable.transferFromUser(0xUserAddress, 50);
```
This call will transfer 50 tokens from `0xUserAddress `to the contract's address without the user's explicit consent for this specific transfer.


# Impact
Unauthorized transfer of tokens.
Complete loss of funds from the` payer` address if the approval amount is not carefully managed.

# Code Snippet

```solidity
IERC20Upgradeable(underlying).safeTransferFrom(payer, address(this), sendAmount);
```
# Tool used

Manual Review

# Recommendation
The contract should implement additional checks to ensure that transfers are only made with explicit user consent for each transaction. This can be done by requiring users to initiate transfers themselves or by implementing a more sophisticated approval mechanism that limits the scope of approvals.
