# Anyone can call withdrawRewards function before the actual user call it, which makes the withdrawRewards prone to DOS attack.

### Summary
[Comptroller.withdrawRewards](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-union-finance-update-2/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/token/Comptroller.sol#L199) function is an external function which can be called by anyone by providing a legit account and token address. An attacker can dos this function by updating gLastUpdated timestamp before the actual user call to this function.
withdrawRewards internally calls to _accrueRewards function which updates the [gLastUpdated](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-union-finance-update-2/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/token/Comptroller.sol#L234) to current timestamp and thereafter it calls to [_getInflationIndexNew](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-union-finance-update-2/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/token/Comptroller.sol#L303) which assure that timedelta shouldn't be zero but since withdrawRewards can be called by anyone externally a malicious user can call this function again and again to accrue rewards and makes the timedelta = 0. which means when a legitimate user calls withdrawRewards function he will always endup in revert due to timedelta = 0 that makes the user unable to call withdrawRewards when they really wants to.

### Mitigation
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-union-finance-update-2/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/token/Comptroller.sol#L199
Make a require condition under withdrawRewards to be only called by UserManager.
```solidity
function withdrawRewards(address account, address token) external override whenNotPaused returns (uint256) {
   +    require(msg.sender == UserManager,"Revert");
        uint256 amount = _accrueRewards(account, token);
        if (amount > 0 && unionToken.balanceOf(address(this)) >= amount) {
            users[account][token].accrued = 0;
            -----------------
