# `ERC1155Voucher#transferERC20()` & `VouchFaucet#transferERC20()` would never work for USDT


## Summary

`ERC1155Voucher#transferERC20()` & `VouchFaucet#transferERC20()` would never work for USDT and neither would `VouchFaucet#constructor()`

## Vulnerability Detail

Take a look at https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-union-finance-update-2/blob/7ffe43f68a1b8e8de1dfd9de5a4d89c90fd6f710/union-v2-contracts/contracts/peripheral/ERC1155Voucher.sol#L162-L164

```solidity
    function transferERC20(address token, address to, uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {
        IERC20(token).transfer(to, amount);
    }
```

And https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-union-finance-update-2/blob/7ffe43f68a1b8e8de1dfd9de5a4d89c90fd6f710/union-v2-contracts/contracts/peripheral/VouchFaucet.sol#L123-L125

```solidity
    function transferERC20(address token, address to, uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {
        IERC20(token).transfer(to, amount);
    }
```

This function transfers ERC20 tokens, now from the readMe, we can see the sets of tokens that are to be supported, i.e https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-union-finance-update-2/blob/7ffe43f68a1b8e8de1dfd9de5a4d89c90fd6f710/README.md#L14-L16

### Q: If you are integrating tokens, are you allowing only whitelisted tokens to work with the codebase or any complying with the standard? Are they assumed to have certain properties, e.g. be non-reentrant? Are there any types of [weird tokens](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20) you want to integrate?

USDC, USDT, DAI

```

Problem however is that the `transferERC20` would never work for USDT unlike the other two supported tokens, this is because the USDT native transfer/transferFrom does not return a bool.

That is going to openzeppelin's ERC20's `approve/transfer/transferFrom()` implementation we can see them specified like this https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol#L41-L78

```rust
    function transfer(address to, uint256 value) external returns (bool);
    (...snip)
    function approve(address spender, uint256 value) external returns (bool);
    (...snip)
    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 value) external returns (bool);
```

But see `L199, L340 & L344` from `USDT`'s contract https://etherscan.io/token/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7#code

We can see that the definition of the functions are

```rust
    function approve(address _spender, uint _value) public
(...snip)
    function transfer(address _to, uint _value) public
(...snip)
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint _value)
```

This will then lead to different opcodes compiled by the compiler: when checking the length of the return data, `usdt.approve/transfer/transferFrom()` requires the length of the return data to be 0, while `ERC20.approve/transfer/transferFrom()` requires the length of the return data to be 1. Therefore, the **tx always reverts**.

## Impact

Protocol's important functionality would be broken, considering `ERC1155Voucher#transferERC20()` would be non-functional for some to be integrated tokens.

Similarly there would be issues with VouchFacet's deployments too considering the non-safe approval method is being used in the constructor, i.e https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-union-finance-update-2/blob/7ffe43f68a1b8e8de1dfd9de5a4d89c90fd6f710/union-v2-contracts/contracts/peripheral/VouchFaucet.sol#L59-L68

```solidity
    constructor(address _userManager, uint256 _trustAmount) {
        address stakingToken = IUserManager(_userManager).stakingToken();

        IERC20(stakingToken).approve(_userManager, 0);
        IERC20(stakingToken).approve(_userManager, type(uint256).max);

        STAKING_TOKEN = stakingToken;
        USER_MANAGER = _userManager;
        TRUST_AMOUNT = _trustAmount;
    }
```

## Recommendation

Inherit and use the `safe` wrappers for ERC20 operations.
