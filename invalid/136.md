# Repayments/Staking can easily be bricked


## Summary

Repayments/Staking can easily be bricked due to not try/catching. the query to permit.

## Vulnerability Detail

Protocol uses the EIP 2612 permit scheme for repayments both via the UErc20 and UDai, i.e see https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-union-finance-update-2/blob/7ffe43f68a1b8e8de1dfd9de5a4d89c90fd6f710/union-v2-contracts/contracts/market/UErc20.sol#L8-L22

```solidity
    function repayBorrowWithERC20Permit(
        address borrower,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 deadline,
        uint8 v,
        bytes32 r,
        bytes32 s
    ) external whenNotPaused {
        IERC20Permit erc20Token = IERC20Permit(underlying);
        erc20Token.permit(msg.sender, address(this), amount, deadline, v, r, s);

        if (!accrueInterest()) revert AccrueInterestFailed();
        uint256 interest = calculatingInterest(borrower);
        _repayBorrowFresh(msg.sender, borrower, decimalScaling(amount, underlyingDecimal), interest);
    }
```

And https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-union-finance-update-2/blob/7ffe43f68a1b8e8de1dfd9de5a4d89c90fd6f710/union-v2-contracts/contracts/market/UDai.sol#L9-L24

```solidity
    function repayBorrowWithPermit(
        address borrower,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 nonce,
        uint256 expiry,
        uint8 v,
        bytes32 r,
        bytes32 s
    ) external whenNotPaused {
        IDai erc20Token = IDai(underlying);
        erc20Token.permit(msg.sender, address(this), nonce, expiry, true, v, r, s);

        if (!accrueInterest()) revert AccrueInterestFailed();
        uint256 interest = calculatingInterest(borrower);
        _repayBorrowFresh(msg.sender, borrower, decimalScaling(amount, underlyingDecimal), interest);
    }
```

Whereas this would work as intended, issue is that anyone can effectively break the repayments by frontrunning the repayments with directly calling the `permit()`, which would then make the honest users attempt always [fail](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-union-finance-update-2/blob/7ffe43f68a1b8e8de1dfd9de5a4d89c90fd6f710/union-v2-contracts/contracts/market/UDai.sol#L19).

## Impact

Repayments would be impossible for quite little cost and could be DOS'd for as long as possible.
