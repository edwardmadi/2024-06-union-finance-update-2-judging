# `VouchFacet::claimTokens` missing validation checks for amount causing caller to claim more token that they actually own.

### Summary

The `claimTokens` function allows users to request a specific amount of tokens. However, it needs to ensure that the requested amount is not more than the maximum amount the user is allowed to claim. This is to prevent users from withdrawing more tokens than they are entitled to. The function checks how many tokens the user has already claimed using the `claimedTokens` mapping but currently does not verify if the requested amount exceeds the maximum claimable amount.

### Root Cause

Root cause of this vulnerability is the missing check about the caller provided `amount` compared to `maxClaimable` prior to making transfer to the caller

### Impact

This can potentially leads to caller to claim more token than what they actually own.

### PoC

### Mitigation

I recommed the following changes in the function:

```diff
function claimTokens(address token, uint256 amount) external {
        require(claimedTokens[token][msg.sender] <= maxClaimable[token], "amount>max"); 
+       require(amount <= maxClaimable[token], "amount>max");
        IERC20(token).transfer(msg.sender, amount); 
        emit TokensClaimed(msg.sender, token, amount);
    }
