# Unsafe Casting

# Summary
Downcasting `int/uints` in Solidity can be unsafe due to the potential for data loss and unintended behavior.When downcasting a larger integer type to a smaller one (etc.` uint256 `to uint128), the value may exceed the range of the target type,leading to truncation and loss of significant digits. 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-union-finance-update-2/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/peripheral/ERC1155Voucher.sol#L135

The vulnerability lies in the fact that Solidity does not automatically check for these overflows and truncations, which can lead to silent errors and security vulnerabilities in the smart contract.

# Vulnerability Detail

In the original code example:

```solidity
IUserManager(USER_MANAGER).updateTrust(acc, uint96(trustAmount));
```
1. Suppose, `trustAmount` is  a `uint256` value.
2. It is being downcast to `uint96` when passed to `updateTrust`.
3. If `trustAmount` exceeds 2**96 - 1, the value will be truncated, potentially leading to incorrect trust values being set in the user manager.


# Impact
Leading to potential data loss and unintended behavior

# Code Snippet

```solidity
IUserManager(USER_MANAGER).updateTrust(acc, uint96(trustAmount));
```

# Tool used
Manual Review

# Recommendation

To prevent this issue, always ensure that the value being downcast is within the range of the target type. One way to achieve this is by adding an explicit check:

```solidity
require(trustAmount <= type(uint96).max, "Value exceeds uint96 range");
IUserManager(USER_MANAGER).updateTrust(acc, uint96(trustAmount));
```

By adding this check, the contract will revert if `trustAmount` exceeds the maximum value that `uint96` can hold, thus preventing data loss and unintended behavior.
