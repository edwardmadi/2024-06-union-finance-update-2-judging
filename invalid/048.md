# Assumption can be broken because the function setUToken and setUserManager will not revert when they should.

## Summary

The functions `setUToken` and `setUserManager` in the contract do not revert when setting a `UToken` or `UserManager` for a token that already has one. This oversight breaks the assumption that only one `UToken` or `UserManager` should be set per token, leading to potential inconsistencies and errors in the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail

The current implementations of `setUToken` and `setUserManager` functions allow an admin to set a new `UToken` or `UserManager` for a token without checking if one has already been set. This can lead to multiple `UToken` or `UserManager` contracts being associated with a single underlying token, which violates the intended design .

### Problematic Code Snippets

```solidity
function setUToken(address token, address uToken) external onlyAdmin {
    uTokens[token] = uToken;
    emit LogAddUToken(token, uToken);
}

function setUserManager(address token, address userManager) external onlyAdmin {
    userManagers[token] = userManager;
    emit LogAddUserManager(token, userManager);
}
```

In these functions, there is no check to see if a `UToken` or `UserManager` has already been set for the token, allowing these mappings to be overwritten.


## Impact

The impact of this vulnerability includes:
- Violation of the assumption that only one `UToken` and one `UserManager` should be set per token.
- Potential inconsistencies and errors in the protocol due to multiple `UToken` or `UserManager` contracts being associated with a single token.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To mitigate this issue, add checks to the `setUToken` and `setUserManager` functions to ensure that a `UToken` or `UserManager` has not already been set for the token. If one has already been set, the function should revert. Here is the recommended implementation:

```solidity
function setUToken(address token, address uToken) external onlyAdmin {
    require(uTokens[token] == address(0), "UToken already set for this token");
    uTokens[token] = uToken;
    emit LogAddUToken(token, uToken);
}

function setUserManager(address token, address userManager) external onlyAdmin {
    require(userManagers[token] == address(0), "UserManager already set for this token");
    userManagers[token] = userManager;
    emit LogAddUserManager(token, userManager);
}
```
