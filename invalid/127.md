# Unsafe downcasting arithmetic operation in `VouchFaucet.sol`

## Summary
Unsafe downcasting arithmetic operation in `VouchFaucet.sol`
## Vulnerability Detail
- Value is being unsafely downcasted from uint256 to uint96 which can cause of precision loss of variable.
- The number would be broken if the variable number is greater than uint96.
- This exists in `VouchFaucet.sol::stake()` and in `TRUST_AMOUNT`
## Impact
- Unsafe downcasting can create loss of number if the value is greater than uint96.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Just use uint256, or use openzeppelin safeCasting.
