# Fee-on-transfer

## Summary
Some tokens take a transfer fee (e.g. STA, PAXG), some do not currently charge a fee but may do so in the future (e.g. `USDT`, `USDC`).
## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
The current implementation doesn't work with fee-on-transfer underlying tokens. Considering that Union can have these kind of tokens (ex. USDT, USDC can activate fees), this issue can affect the protocol.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
For fee-on-transfer tokens, check the balance before and after the transfer and use the difference as the actual amount received.
