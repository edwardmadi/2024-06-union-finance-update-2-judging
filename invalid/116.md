# Use a safe transfer helper library for ERC20 transfers

## Summary
- Use a safe transfer helper library for ERC20 transfers

## Vulnerability Detail
- `VouchFaucet::claimTokens()` function does not check the return value of these calls. Tokens that return false rather than revert to indicate failed transfers may silently fail rather than reverting as expected.
- Since the IERC20 interface requires a boolean return value, attempting to transfer ERC20s with [missing return values](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#missing-return-values) will revert. This means it  cannot support a number of popular ERC20s, including USDT and BNB and many others
## Impact
- It would not revert even though the transaction failed.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use a safe transfer library like OpenZeppelin [SafeERC20](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc20#SafeERC20) to ensure consistent handling of ERC20 return values and abstract over [inconsistent ERC20](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20) implementations.
