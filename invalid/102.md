# Any user can claim an unlimited amount of vouch in `VouchFaucet.sol`

## Summary
Currently, there is no validation performed in `VouchFaucet.sol` when `claimVouch` is called. This is highly dangerous as any untrusted user can increase their vouch and perform malicious borrows, stealing from the contract's stake.

## Vulnerability Detail
As we can see in the `claimVouch` function there is no validation performed and it can be called by any address:
```solidity
function claimVouch() external {
        IUserManager(USER_MANAGER).updateTrust(msg.sender, uint96(TRUST_AMOUNT));
        emit VouchClaimed(msg.sender);
}
```

In addition to that, the maximum amount of trust that any user can claim - `TRUST_AMOUNT` can easily be bypassed by calling `claimVouch`, borrowing the entire `TRUST_AMOUNT` and after that calling `claimVouch` again.

## Impact
Malicious borrows can be made by untrusted users and the maximum amount that can be vouched for a user can be bypassed, putting the contract's funds at risk of being stolen.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Only users approved by the owner should be able to call `claimVouch` and they should not be able to claim more trust than `TRUST_AMOUNT`.
