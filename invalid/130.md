# The UserManager contract is incompatible with USDT

### Summary

The `UserManager` contract doesn't account for fee-on-transfer tokens, such as USDT.

There're currently 3 tokens listed as supported on Union Finance: USDT, DAI and USDC.

USDT is generally a standard ERC20 token, however it has a fee-on-transfer feature:

```solidity
    // Forward ERC20 methods to upgraded contract if this one is deprecated
    function transfer(address _to, uint _value) public whenNotPaused {
        require(!isBlackListed[msg.sender]);
        if (deprecated) {
            return UpgradedStandardToken(upgradedAddress).transferByLegacy(msg.sender, _to, _value);
        } else {
            return super.transfer(_to, _value);
        }
    }
```

### Root Cause

Due to not checking the so-called `balanceBefore` and `balanceAfter` values, the `UserManager` contract fails to correctly set the current user's staked balance and accrue rewards properly (as for properly calculating rewards it'd need to kepep track of the **real** current balance of the contract and set **it** to the `_totalStaked` tracker variable).

The problem lays in this line: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-union-finance-update-2/blob/7ffe43f68a1b8e8de1dfd9de5a4d89c90fd6f710/union-v2-contracts/contracts/user/UserManager.sol#L750.

The following is the snippet of the culprit:
```solidity
    function stake(uint96 amount) public whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
        IERC20Upgradeable erc20Token = IERC20Upgradeable(stakingToken);
        uint96 actualAmount = decimalScaling(uint256(amount), stakingTokenDecimal).toUint96();
        comptroller.withdrawRewards(msg.sender, stakingToken);

        Staker storage staker = _stakers[msg.sender];

        if (staker.stakedAmount + actualAmount > _maxStakeAmount) revert StakeLimitReached();

        staker.stakedAmount += actualAmount;
        _totalStaked += actualAmount;

        erc20Token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount); // @@ <<< here there may be a subtracted fee!
        uint256 currentAllowance = erc20Token.allowance(address(this), assetManager);
        if (currentAllowance < amount) {
            erc20Token.safeIncreaseAllowance(assetManager, amount - currentAllowance);
        }

        if (!IAssetManager(assetManager).deposit(stakingToken, amount)) revert AssetManagerDepositFailed();
        emit LogStake(msg.sender, amount);
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

This problem is implictly bound in the current logic.

### External pre-conditions

None, the problem is always there in the `UserManager` contract that has its `stakingToken` (aka `erc20Token` in the `stake` function) set-up as USDT.

### Attack Path

Staking always tracks a wrong current real balance amount.

### Impact

Due to that, the `_totalStaked` and `staker.stakedAmount` will be incorrect.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider checking the balance before the ERC20 transfer, then checking the balance after the ERC20 transfer, and subtracting one from the other one to get the **REAL** amount of USDT that was transferred, accounting for the fees properly:
```diff
    function stake(uint96 amount) public whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
        IERC20Upgradeable erc20Token = IERC20Upgradeable(stakingToken);
        uint96 actualAmount = decimalScaling(uint256(amount), stakingTokenDecimal).toUint96();
        comptroller.withdrawRewards(msg.sender, stakingToken);

        Staker storage staker = _stakers[msg.sender];

        if (staker.stakedAmount + actualAmount > _maxStakeAmount) revert StakeLimitReached();

        staker.stakedAmount += actualAmount;
        _totalStaked += actualAmount;

        uint256 balanceBefore = erc20Token.balanceOf(address(this));

        erc20Token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
        uint256 currentAllowance = erc20Token.allowance(address(this), assetManager);
        if (currentAllowance < amount) {
            erc20Token.safeIncreaseAllowance(assetManager, amount - currentAllowance);
        }

        if (!IAssetManager(assetManager).deposit(stakingToken, amount)) revert AssetManagerDepositFailed();
        emit LogStake(msg.sender, amount);
    }
```
