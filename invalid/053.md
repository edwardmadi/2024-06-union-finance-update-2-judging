# `UToken.redeem` function incorrectly reduces the converted `amountIn` input

## Summary
`UToken.redeem` function incorrectly reduces the converted `amountIn` input even though it is not intended to be inputted as scaled.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `UToken.redeem`, `amountIn` and `amountIn` can be inputted. As any user input across the contracts, the user need to provide a value in `underlyingDecimal`.
[UToken.sol#L845-L874](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-union-finance-update-2/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/market/UToken.sol#L845-L874)
```solidity
    function redeem(uint256 amountIn, uint256 amountOut) external override whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
        if (!accrueInterest()) revert AccrueInterestFailed();
        if (amountIn != 0 && amountOut != 0) revert AmountError();
        if (amountIn == 0 && amountOut == 0) revert AmountZero();


        uint256 exchangeRate = _exchangeRateStored();


        // Amount of the underlying token to redeem
        uint256 underlyingAmount = amountOut;


        if (amountIn > 0) {
            // We calculate the exchange rate and the amount of underlying to be redeemed:
            // underlyingAmount = amountIn x _exchangeRateStored
            underlyingAmount = decimalReducing((amountIn * exchangeRate) / WAD, underlyingDecimal);
        }


        uint256 remaining = IAssetManager(assetManager).withdraw(underlying, msg.sender, underlyingAmount);
        // If the remaining amount is greater than or equal to the
        // underlyingAmount then we weren't able to withdraw enough
        // to cover this redemption
        if (remaining >= underlyingAmount) revert WithdrawFailed();


        uint256 actualAmount = decimalScaling(underlyingAmount - remaining, underlyingDecimal);
        uint256 realUtokenAmount = (actualAmount * WAD) / exchangeRate;
        if (realUtokenAmount == 0) revert AmountZero();
        _burn(msg.sender, realUtokenAmount);


        _totalRedeemable -= actualAmount;
        emit LogRedeem(msg.sender, amountIn, amountOut, realUtokenAmount, actualAmount);
    }
```
However, `amountIn` even if provided as not scaled is being reduced when calculating the `underlyingAmount` to withdraw:
[UToken.sol#L858](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-union-finance-update-2/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/market/UToken.sol#L858)
```solidity
            underlyingAmount = decimalReducing((amountIn * exchangeRate) / WAD, underlyingDecimal);
```

Users are never intended to provide scaled quantities as input as they are only used for internal accounting. The only time scaled quantities are used as input is when contracts perform external calls to one another.

## Impact
This is an issue that can be mitigated at the UI level, but I still believe Medium severity is appropriate because if this UI conversion is not used (which I think it would not have been used since users provide inputs in underlying decimals everywhere), it would lead to users possibly redeeming a different amount of tokens than they intended to.

For instance, for a given underlying decimal is it possible that a user both can withdraw the correct `underlyingAmount` and the reduced `underlyingAmount` if the user balance is enough for both values.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider not reducing the inputed `amountIn`.
```diff
function redeem(uint256 amountIn, uint256 amountOut) external override whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
    // ...

    if (amountIn > 0) {
        // We calculate the exchange rate and the amount of underlying to be redeemed:
        // underlyingAmount = amountIn x _exchangeRateStored
-        underlyingAmount = decimalReducing((amountIn * exchangeRate) / WAD, underlyingDecimal);
+        underlyingAmount =(amountIn * exchangeRate) / WAD;
    }

    // ...
}
```
