# Insufficient Allowance Management in Peripheral Contracts Cause DoS on `stake()` functions

## Summary
The `VouchFaucet` and `ERC1155Voucher` contracts does not properly manage allowances for token transfers when staking tokens to the `userManager` contract. Both contracts are setting maximum allowance in constrcutor, but not adjusting the allowance after each stakes. This can lead to failed transactions due to insufficient allowance when the contract attempts to transfer tokens after a (long) period of time.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `stake()` function in the `VouchFaucet` contract calls the `stake()` method of the `userManager` contract, 

```solidity
    function stake() external {
        address stakingToken = STAKING_TOKEN;
        uint256 balance = IERC20(stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this));
@>>     IUserManager(USER_MANAGER).stake(uint96(balance));
    }
```

And the `userManager.stake()` transferring fund from `VouchFaucet` contract to `userManager` contract while staking.

```solidity
    erc20Token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-union-finance-update-2/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/user/UserManager.sol#L750

but both the contracts does not ensure that the contract has set the necessary allowance for the `userManager` contract to transfer tokens from its balance. The already provided allowance will be reduced over time by performing more and more staking. Without enogh allowance in future, the transactions will be fail when the `stake()` function is executed.

## Impact
If the `stake()` function is called without prior setup of the appropriate allowance, it will result in a failure to stake tokens, potentially locking users out of the functionality. This can affect the usability of the contract and lead to a poor user experience.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a check for the current allowance in the `stake()` function and increase it as necessary before calling the `stake()` method on the `userManager` contract.

```diff
/// @notice Stake into the UserManager contract
function stake() external {
    address stakingToken = STAKING_TOKEN;
    uint256 balance = IERC20(stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this));
    
+   // Ensure the contract has enough allowance for USER_MANAGER
+   uint256 currentAllowance = IERC20(stakingToken).allowance(address(this), USER_MANAGER);
+   if (currentAllowance < balance) {
+       IERC20(stakingToken).safeIncreaseAllowance(USER_MANAGER, balance - currentAllowance);
+   }

    IUserManager(USER_MANAGER).stake(uint96(balance));
}
```
