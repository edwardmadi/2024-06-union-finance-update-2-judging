# Functions that require permits can be called only by the permit creator

## Summary
`repayBorrowWithPermit`, `repayBorrowWithERC20Permit`, `registerMemberWithPermit`, `stakeWithPermit` and `stakeWithERC20Permit` are allowed to be called by the permit creator only. No other addresses will be allowed to execute these functions on behalf of the signer, which is the sole purpose of the functions that require permits.

## Vulnerability Detail
Let's take a look at the `repayBorrowWithPermit` function:
```solidity
function repayBorrowWithPermit(
        address borrower,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 nonce,
        uint256 expiry,
        uint8 v,
        bytes32 r,
        bytes32 s
    ) external whenNotPaused {
        IDai erc20Token = IDai(underlying);
        erc20Token.permit(msg.sender, address(this), nonce, expiry, true, v, r, s);

        if (!accrueInterest()) revert AccrueInterestFailed();
        uint256 interest = calculatingInterest(borrower);
        _repayBorrowFresh(msg.sender, borrower, decimalScaling(amount, underlyingDecimal), interest);
    }
```

The function calls `erc20Token.permit`, supplying `msg.sender` as the 'owner' of the permit and `address(this)` as the 'spender' of the permit.

Therefore, the only way the functions can be successful is when the creator of the permit is the same as the `msg.sender`. However, the sole purpose of the permit is to allow the permit creator to sign the approve data, so that the signature can be used by another address to execute calls on behalf of the permit creator.

Here is the same issue found in a recent competition: https://code4rena.com/reports/2023-07-pooltogether#m-25-depositwithpermit-and-mintwithpermit-are-allowed-to-be-called-by-the-permit-creator-only

## Impact
As a result, `repayBorrowWithPermit`, `repayBorrowWithERC20Permit`, `registerMemberWithPermit`, `stakeWithPermit` and `stakeWithERC20Permit` will not function as intended and will essentially not fulfill their purpose.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Instead of `msg.sender`, use another user-supplied address, for example `owner`:
```solidity
function repayBorrowWithPermit(
        address owner,
        address borrower,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 nonce,
        uint256 expiry,
        uint8 v,
        bytes32 r,
        bytes32 s
    ) external whenNotPaused {
        IDai erc20Token = IDai(underlying);
        erc20Token.permit(owner, address(this), nonce, expiry, true, v, r, s);

        if (!accrueInterest()) revert AccrueInterestFailed();
        uint256 interest = calculatingInterest(borrower);
        _repayBorrowFresh(owner, borrower, decimalScaling(amount, underlyingDecimal), interest);
    }
```
