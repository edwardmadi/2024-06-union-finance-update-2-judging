# Critical Debt Manipulation Exploit in Borrow Function Allows Unlimited Borrowing and Debt Erasure

## Summary
A critical vulnerability has been identified in the `borrow` function of the lending protocol. This vulnerability allows malicious users to manipulate their debt, potentially erasing existing borrowings and exceeding their borrowing limits. The root cause is the improper handling of multiple borrow calls within the same block, leading to a reset of the user's borrowed amount and interest calculations.
## Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerability stems from the interaction between the accrueInterest function and the `borrow` function. When multiple borrow calls are made within the same block:

The `accrueInterest` function doesn't increase the `borrowIndex `due to zero time elapsed.
This causes borrowBalanceStoredInternal(msg.sender) to return 0 for subsequent borrows in the same block.
The borrow function then uses this 0 value to calculate new borrows, effectively erasing previous debt.

Key Vunerable
```solidity
uint256 borrowedAmount = borrowBalanceStoredInternal(msg.sender);
// ...
uint256 accountBorrowsNew = borrowedAmount + actualAmount + fee;
uint256 totalBorrowsNew = _totalBorrows + actualAmount + fee;
// ...
accountBorrows[msg.sender].principal += actualAmount + fee;
uint256 newPrincipal = _getBorrowed(msg.sender);
accountBorrows[msg.sender].interest = accountBorrowsNew - newPrincipal;
```


An attacker with an initial debt of 1000 tokens could:

Call borrow multiple times in a single block, each time for 1000 tokens.
End up owing only 1000 tokens instead of the correct 4000 tokens (or more with interest).
Effectively drain the protocol of funds by borrowing far more than allowed and having most of the debt erased.
## Impact
Impact
The impact of this vulnerability is severe and multi-faceted:

Debt Erasure: Attackers can erase their previous debt by making multiple borrows in the same block. Each new borrow overwrites the old debt instead of adding to it.
Interest Evasion: Attackers avoid paying interest on previous borrows as the system treats each borrow in the block as if it were the first.
Inflated Borrowing Power: Users can borrow far beyond their allowed limit, as each borrow in the same block resets their borrowed amount.
Manipulation of Total Borrows: The _totalBorrows variable is not correctly updated, leading to an understatement of the total debt in the system.
Incorrect Interest Calculation: The interest calculation becomes inaccurate, often resulting in zero or negligible interest on large borrowings.
Bypass of Debt Ceiling: The check against _debtCeiling becomes ineffective, allowing borrowing beyond the intended global maximum.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To address the identified critical vulnerability, we recommend implementing the following measures:

1. **Cooldown Period Between Borrows:**
   Introduce a cooldown period to prevent rapid successive borrow actions.

   ```solidity
   mapping(address => uint256) public lastBorrowTimestamp;
   uint256 public constant BORROW_COOLDOWN = 1 minutes;

   function borrow(address to, uint256 amount) external {
       require(block.timestamp > lastBorrowTimestamp[msg.sender] + BORROW_COOLDOWN, "Borrow cooldown not elapsed");
       // ... rest of the borrow function ...
       lastBorrowTimestamp[msg.sender] = block.timestamp;
   }
   ```

2. **Cumulative Interest Rate Mechanism:**
   Implement a cumulative interest rate mechanism that does not solely depend on block timestamps.

3. **Debt Consistency Check:**
   Ensure the new borrow amount is consistently added to the existing debt.

   ```solidity
   uint256 existingDebt = borrowBalanceStoredInternal(msg.sender);
   require(existingDebt > 0 || borrowedAmount == 0, "Inconsistent debt state");
   uint256 accountBorrowsNew = existingDebt + actualAmount + fee;
   ```

These measures will enhance the security and reliability of the borrowing functionality in your smart contract.
