# `UserManager::updateTrust` allows staker to increase their trust for another user despite being overdue on their loan

### Summary

This oversight in `UserManager::updateTrust` undermines the core principle of Union's credit system. This vulnerability compromises the integrity of this system by allowing obviously unreliable actors to extend more credit. As the protocol relies on a network of trust, this vulnerability could create a domino effect of defaults and over-extended credit lines, potentially destabilizing the entire system.

### Root Cause

In `UserManager.sol` there should be check for whether the staker is overdue if the new trust amount is higher than the current trust amount. The same as there is in the `else` block for creating a new vouch.

### Internal pre-conditions

All involved parties must be members of the Union protocol.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. `Staker` updates trust for `borrower` to 100 DAI.
2. `Staker` borrows 100 DAI against extended trust from another user.
3. Overdue time passes (30 days currently) without `staker` paying on their loan.
4. `Staker` updates trust for `borrower` to 200 DAI.
5. `Borrower` borrows 200 DAI against the unreliable trust.

### Impact

This vulnerability poses a significant threat to the integrity of the protocol's its trust-based credit system. By allowing users to increase credit lines even when overdue on loans, it undermines the core principles of responsible lending and could lead to a cascade of defaults.

### PoC

Add the following lines to the `vouching.ts` hardhat integration test setup:
```diff
    context("Adjusting trust", () => {
        let staker: Signer;
        let borrower: Signer;
+        let staker2: Signer;

        before(async () => {
            await beforeContext();
            staker = signers[0];
            borrower = signers[1];
+            staker2 = signers[2];
```
And the add and run the following test:
```typescript
        it("can increase trust amount when overdue", async () => {
            const newTrustAmount = trustAmount.div(2);
            await helpers.stake(trustAmount, staker2);
            await helpers.updateTrust(staker, borrower, newTrustAmount);
            const [vouchAmountBefore] = await helpers.getVouchingAmounts(borrower, staker);
            console.log("Init vouch amount:", vouchAmountBefore.toString());

            await helpers.updateTrust(staker2, staker, newTrustAmount);
            const [creditLimit] = await helpers.getCreditLimits(staker);
            console.log("Credit limit staker:", creditLimit.toString());
            helpers.borrow(staker, creditLimit);
            const time = ethers.BigNumber.from(getConfig("default").uToken.overdueTime);
            const timeSkip = time.add(100)
            await ethers.provider.send("evm_increaseTime", [timeSkip.toNumber()])

            await helpers.updateTrust(staker, borrower, trustAmount);
            const [vouchAmountAfter] = await helpers.getVouchingAmounts(borrower, staker);
            console.log("After vouch amount:", vouchAmountAfter.toString());

            const [creditLimitBorrower] = await helpers.getCreditLimits(borrower);
            console.log("Credit limit borrower:", creditLimitBorrower.toString());
            console.log("Amount borrowing:", (trustAmount.mul(900).div(1000)).toString());
            await helpers.borrow(borrower, trustAmount.mul(900).div(1000));

            expect(vouchAmountBefore).eq(newTrustAmount);
            expect(vouchAmountAfter).eq(trustAmount);
        });
```

### Mitigation

Simply add the following check when modifying trust amount in `UserManager.sol::updateTrust`
```diff
        if (index.isSet) {
            // Update existing record checking that the new trust amount is
            // not less than the amount of stake currently locked by the borrower
            Vouch storage vouch = _vouchers[borrower][index.idx];
            if (actualTrustAmount < vouch.locked) revert TrustAmountLtLocked();
+           if (actualTrustAmount > vouch.trust && uToken.checkIsOverdue(staker)) revert VouchWhenOverdue();
            vouch.trust = actualTrustAmount;
```
