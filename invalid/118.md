# Incompatibility With Fee-on-Transfer Tokens

## Summary
Incompatibility of balance when transferring Fee-on-Transfer tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function `deposit()` will transfer the poolToken to the contract:

```solidity
contract AssetManager is Controller, ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable, IAssetManager {
    //...
   function deposit(
        address token,
        uint256 amount
    ) external override whenNotPaused onlyAuth(token) nonReentrant returns (bool) {
        IERC20Upgradeable poolToken = IERC20Upgradeable(token);
        if (amount == 0) revert AmountZero();

        if (!_isUToken(msg.sender, token)) {
>           balances[msg.sender][token] += amount;
            totalPrincipal[token] += amount;
        }

        bool remaining = true;
>       poolToken.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
        //..
    }
}
```
We can find that the balance of `msg.sender` will record the input param `amount`, however, the issue is here that if the `poolToken` is a FoT token(e.g., deflationary token). Certain tokens (e.g., STA or PAXG) charge a fee for transfers and others (e.g., USDT or USDC) may start doing so in the future. As a result, the actual amount received of tokens will be less than input param `amount`, due to the charged transaction fee.


## Impact
an inconsistency in the `amount` will occur and the contract may not have enough tokens to pay back to users when they withdraw tokens via `withdraw` function.

You can find the critical hack events in several `Balancer` pools because of FoT token vulnerability ([more details](https://medium.com/@1inch.exchange/balancer-hack-2020-a8f7131c980e)).

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider recording the actual amount received in the function:

```solidity
contract AssetManager is Controller, ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable, IAssetManager {
    //...
   function deposit(
        address token,
        uint256 amount
    ) external override whenNotPaused onlyAuth(token) nonReentrant returns (bool) {
        IERC20Upgradeable poolToken = IERC20Upgradeable(token);
        if (amount == 0) revert AmountZero();

+       uint256 balanceBefore = poolToken.balanceOf(address(this));
+       poolToken.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
+       uint256 actualAmount = poolToken.balanceOf(address(this)) - balanceBefore;

        if (!_isUToken(msg.sender, token)) {
+         balances[msg.sender][token] += actualAmount;
+         totalPrincipal[token] += actualAmount;
        }

        //..
    }
}
```
