# `UToken.sol`'s `redeem` function rounds against the protocol

## Summary
The `UToken.sol` `redeem` function rounds in the wrong direction when calculating the number of tokens the caller needs to burn in order to withdraw their underlying funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
As we can see in the `redeem` function of `UToken.sol`:
```solidity
int256 realUtokenAmount = (actualAmount * WAD) / exchangeRate;
```

`realUtokenAmount`, which is the amount of UToken that the user needs to burn, is calcuclated by rounding down. This, however, is wrong and may pose a danger to the protocol.
As the rounding does not favour the protocol, a redeemer will be able to redeem an amount of underlying, while burning an amount of UToken that is slightly less than what the underlying is actually worth.

This would pose an issue when only one user is left to redeem their tokens as there may not be enough of the underlying token for the last user to redeem the entirety of their UToken, causing the function to revert.

## Impact
A user may not be able to redeem all of their UToken.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
`realUtokenAmount` should round in favour of the protocol:
```solidity
uint256 realUtokenAmount = (actualAmount * WAD + (exchangeRate - 1)) / exchangeRate;
```
