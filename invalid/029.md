# Interest Free Loans can be obtained from the Contract

## Summary

When a loan is written off the interest and the interest index are not updated accordingly. Write-off is another form of repayment of bad debt. in the former audit, a vulnerability was observed because lastrepay was not updated. 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance-judging/issues/115

This report identifies another vulnerability because interest is not calculated and updated accordingly.
A Malicious user can deliberately borrow with no intention of repaying, forcing the debt writeoff to be called but when this is called all the debt of the User is cleared but the owed interest is not accounted for hence the contract loses out of its revenue.

The interest is not written off but the contract fails to store this value hence interest is not applied and thus the Malicious user can borrow again without repaying any interest on the former loan. Thus this can be repeated over and over and over again.


## Vulnerability Detail


When the loan has been written off the user can borrow another amount with loan. interest = 0 since it was not set when the debt was written-off, thereby a malicious user can avoid paying any interest by neglecting the principal/loan.

```solidity
    function debtWriteOff(address borrower, uint256 amount) external override whenNotPaused onlyUserManager {
        if (amount == 0) revert AmountZero();
        uint256 actualAmount = decimalScaling(amount, underlyingDecimal);

        uint256 oldPrincipal = _getBorrowed(borrower);
        uint256 repayAmount = actualAmount > oldPrincipal ? oldPrincipal : actualAmount;

        accountBorrows[borrower].principal = oldPrincipal - repayAmount;
        _totalBorrows -= repayAmount;

        if (repayAmount == oldPrincipal) {
            // If all principal is written off, we can reset the last repaid time to 0.
            // which indicates that the borrower has no outstanding loans.
            accountBorrows[borrower].lastRepay = 0;
        }
    }
```
From the above implementation it can be noted that interest and interestrateindex are not set. 

Because interest is not set in the wrote-off function, when calculating interest is Called it will return zero once the debt is written off.

```solidity
  function calculatingInterest(address account) public view override returns (uint256) {
        return decimalReducing(_calculatingInterest(account), underlyingDecimal);
    } 
```

With this clean slate a Malicious user is encouraged to borrow again, Knowing fully well that he is not going to repay the former interest. 

```solidity
        function borrow(address to, uint256 amount) external override onlyMember(msg.sender) whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
         ..................................................
   @audit >> Former interest should be reflected here but it returns 0>>    uint256 borrowedAmount = borrowBalanceStoredInternal(msg.sender);

        // Initialize the last repayment date to the current block timestamp
        if (getLastRepay(msg.sender) == 0) {
            accountBorrows[msg.sender].lastRepay = getTimestamp();
        }

        // Withdraw the borrowed amount of tokens from the assetManager and send them to the borrower
        uint256 remaining = assetManagerContract.withdraw(underlying, to, amount);
        if (remaining > amount) revert WithdrawFailed();
        actualAmount -= decimalScaling(remaining, underlyingDecimal);

        fee = calculatingFee(actualAmount);
        uint256 accountBorrowsNew = borrowedAmount + actualAmount + fee;
        uint256 totalBorrowsNew = _totalBorrows + actualAmount + fee;
        if (totalBorrowsNew > _debtCeiling) revert AmountExceedGlobalMax();

        // Update internal balances
        accountBorrows[msg.sender].principal += actualAmount + fee;
        uint256 newPrincipal = _getBorrowed(msg.sender);

    @audit >> Interest is 0 >>       accountBorrows[msg.sender].interest = accountBorrowsNew - newPrincipal;

        accountBorrows[msg.sender].interestIndex = borrowIndex;
        _totalBorrows = totalBorrowsNew;

   
    }
```

## Impact
Interest is not updated on loan write-off hence principal is cleared by the staker but interest is not set and the borrower successfully evades payments and goes free with an interest-free loan.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Set the interest and interate index before debt write-off to ensure that a user pays even if their debt(Principal) is written off

```solidity
      function debtWriteOff(address borrower, uint256 amount) external override whenNotPaused onlyUserManager {
        if (amount == 0) revert AmountZero();
      ++   if (!accrueInterest()) revert AccrueInterestFailed();
      ++   uint256 interest = _calculatingInterest(borrower);

        uint256 actualAmount = decimalScaling(amount, underlyingDecimal);

        uint256 oldPrincipal = _getBorrowed(borrower);
        uint256 repayAmount = actualAmount > oldPrincipal ? oldPrincipal : actualAmount;

        accountBorrows[borrower].principal = oldPrincipal - repayAmount;
        _totalBorrows -= repayAmount;

       ++  accountBorrows[borrower].interest= interest;
       ++  accountBorrows[borrower].interestIndex = borrowIndex

        if (repayAmount == oldPrincipal) {
            // If all principal is written off, we can reset the last repaid time to 0.
            // which indicates that the borrower has no outstanding loans.
            accountBorrows[borrower].lastRepay = 0;
         }
      } 
```
