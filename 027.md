# Users can accrue more rewards by timing the call to accrueRewards function by front/back running other transactions

## Summary
The size of reward accrued is tied to the net total staked at the time of claiming the rewards. So, users can time their `accrueRewards` call by front/back running the transactions that will increase their reward accruals. There is a possibility of step wise jump in the reward rate based on size of staking or unstaking or write off. An attacker can abuse these setup wise jumps to accrue rewards.

## Vulnerability Detail
The rewards accrued is based on `globalTotalStaked` which inflates the `curInflationIndex` when the globalTotalStaked is larger.
So, users can potentially front/back run the transactions that will result in larger `globalTotalStaked` to earn greater rewards.

The scenarios to maximise reward accruals are

a) Staking
    When some other user stakes adding to net total staked, attacker can back run the staking transaction to earn more rewards.

b) Unstaking
    When some other user unstakes, attacker can front run and capture their accrual rewards

c) debtWriteOff
   Attacker can front run the debtWriteOff to capture large accrual rewards.

```solidity
     uint256 amount = _calculateRewardsInternal(account, token, globalTotalStaked, user);
```

`_getInflationIndexNew` function could return a larger number based on the total staked as it pushed the index to a larger number.

```solidity
uint256 index = effectiveTotalStake / halfDecayPoint;
```
The difference between previous index and the new index inflates the rewards and hence can be abused.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The reward rate should be normalised and should not be impacted by events like staking, unstaking. There should be no benefit for any users if they time their reward accrual calls based on other transaction.
