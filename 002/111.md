# Missing Token Validity Check in `onERC1155BatchReceived` in `ERC1155Voucher` contract

## Summary

The `ERC1155Voucher` contract has a discrepancy in the validation of tokens in the `onERC1155Received` and `onERC1155BatchReceived` functions.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `ERC1155Voucher` contract, the `onERC1155Received` function checks if the received token is valid by verifying `isValidToken[msg.sender]`. However, the `onERC1155BatchReceived` function does not perform this check, allowing potentially invalid tokens to trigger a vouch operation. This discrepancy could be exploited by an attacker to abuse the vouching mechanism.

**onERC1155Received:**
```solidity
function onERC1155Received(
    address operator,
    address from,
    uint256 id,
    uint256 value,
    bytes calldata data
) external returns (bytes4) {
    require(isValidToken[msg.sender], "!valid token");
    _vouchFor(from);
    return bytes4(keccak256("onERC1155Received(address,address,uint256,uint256,bytes)"));
}
```

**onERC1155BatchReceived:**

```solidity
    function onERC1155BatchReceived(
        address operator,
        address from,
        uint256[] calldata ids,
        uint256[] calldata values,
        bytes calldata data
    ) external returns (bytes4) {
        _vouchFor(from);
        return bytes4(keccak256("onERC1155BatchReceived(address,address,uint256[],uint256[],bytes)"));
    }
```

## Impact

The absence of the validity check in the `onERC1155BatchReceived` function could allow attackers to send invalid tokens to the contract, thereby triggering unauthorized vouch operations. This could compromise the integrity of the trust mechanism implemented by the contract.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a validation check in the `onERC1155BatchReceived` function to ensure the received token is valid. The validation should be similar to the one used in the `onERC1155Received` function:

```diff
    function onERC1155BatchReceived(
        address operator,
        address from,
        uint256[] calldata ids,
        uint256[] calldata values,
        bytes calldata data
    ) external returns (bytes4) {
+       require(isValidToken[msg.sender], "!valid token");
        _vouchFor(from);
        return bytes4(keccak256("onERC1155BatchReceived(address,address,uint256[],uint256[],bytes)"));
    }
```
