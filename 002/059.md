# Missing Validity Check in ERC1155Voucher::onERC1155BatchReceived

## Summary
The `onERC1155BatchReceived` function in the `ERC1155Voucher` contract is missing a required validity check for tokens. This issue can lead to the acceptance and processing of invalid tokens, potentially compromising the security and intended functionality of the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `onERC1155BatchReceived` function handles the receipt of multiple ERC1155 token types. Unlike the `onERC1155Received` function, it does not include a `require` check to verify that the received tokens are valid. 

```solidity
    /// @dev Handles the receipt of a single ERC1155 token type. This function is
    /// @param operator The address which initiated the transfer (i.e. msg.sender)
    /// @param from The address which previously owned the token
    /// @param id The ID of the token being transferred
    /// @param value The amount of tokens being transferred
    /// @param data Additional data with no specified format
    /// @return `bytes4(keccak256("onERC1155Received(address,address,uint256,uint256,bytes)"))` if transfer is allowed
    function onERC1155Received(
        address operator,
        address from,
        uint256 id,
        uint256 value,
        bytes calldata data
    ) external returns (bytes4) {
        require(isValidToken[msg.sender], "!valid token");
        _vouchFor(from);
        return bytes4(keccak256("onERC1155Received(address,address,uint256,uint256,bytes)"));
    }

    /// @dev Handles the receipt of a multiple ERC1155 token types.
    /// @param operator The address which initiated the batch transfer (i.e. msg.sender)
    /// @param from The address which previously owned the token
    /// @param ids An array containing ids of each token being transferred (order and length must match values array)
    /// @param values An array containing amounts of each token being transferred (order and length must match ids array)
    /// @param data Additional data with no specified format
    /// @return `bytes4(keccak256("onERC1155BatchReceived(address,address,uint256[],uint256[],bytes)"))` if transfer is allowed
    function onERC1155BatchReceived(
        address operator,
        address from,
        uint256[] calldata ids,
        uint256[] calldata values,
        bytes calldata data
    ) external returns (bytes4) {
        _vouchFor(from);
        return bytes4(keccak256("onERC1155BatchReceived(address,address,uint256[],uint256[],bytes)"));
    }
```
This inconsistency can result in the contract accepting and processing tokens that are not authorized, which can lead to unintended and potentially malicious behavior.

## Impact
The absence of the `require(isValidToken[msg.sender], "!valid token");` check in the `onERC1155BatchReceived` function can lead to:

- **Security Risk**: Unauthorized tokens being processed, which could compromise the contract's security.
- **Contract Integrity**: The intended behavior and trust relationships within the contract could be affected, undermining the contract's integrity.
- **Financial Loss**: There is a risk of financial loss if invalid tokens cause the contract to behave incorrectly, especially in systems involving staking or financial transactions.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add the require(isValidToken[msg.sender], "!valid token"); check to the onERC1155BatchReceived function to ensure that only valid tokens are accepted and processed by the contract. This will align the function with the onERC1155Received function and enhance the contract's security and integrity.
