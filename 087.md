# Inappropriate handling of tokens sent into the contract in "_repayBorrowFresh" can lead to a reduction in debt even though the contract receive lesser tokens.

## Summary

The `repayBorrowFresh` function in UToken.sol does not properly handle the transferred funds, allowing users to send in fewer tokens than the specified amount. Based on doc
https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/445#:~:text=If%20you%20are,USDC%2C%20USDT%2C%20DAI
USDC and USDT are weird tokens and can implements a fee in the future - https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#:~:text=Fee%20on%20Transfer,%3A%20TransferFee.sol
 Mint function and Add reserve correct handles token sent in but repayborrowfresh fails to handle the token transfered properly. This vulnerability can lead to inconsistencies in debt repayment, with users potentially reducing their debt more than the amount actually received by the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

Kindly take a look at Compoundfinance implementation of the same function. 
https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/blob/a3214f67b73310d547e00fc578e8355911c9d376/contracts/CToken.sol#L672

```solidity
 function repayBorrowFresh(address payer, address borrower, uint repayAmount) internal returns (uint) {
        /* Fail if repayBorrow not allowed */
        uint allowed = comptroller.repayBorrowAllowed(address(this), payer, borrower, repayAmount);
        if (allowed != 0) {
            revert RepayBorrowComptrollerRejection(allowed);
        }

        /* Verify market's block number equals current block number */
        if (accrualBlockNumber != getBlockNumber()) {
            revert RepayBorrowFreshnessCheck();
        }

        /* We fetch the amount the borrower owes, with accumulated interest */
        uint accountBorrowsPrev = borrowBalanceStoredInternal(borrower);

        /* If repayAmount == -1, repayAmount = accountBorrows */
        uint repayAmountFinal = repayAmount == type(uint).max ? accountBorrowsPrev : repayAmount;

        /////////////////////////
        // EFFECTS & INTERACTIONS
        // (No safe failures beyond this point)

        /*
         * We call doTransferIn for the payer and the repayAmount
         *  Note: The cToken must handle variations between ERC-20 and ETH underlying.
         *  On success, the cToken holds an additional repayAmount of cash.
         *  doTransferIn reverts if anything goes wrong, since we can't be sure if side effects occurred.
         *   it returns the amount actually transferred, in case of a fee.
         */
      @audit >> proper handling by compound>>   uint actualRepayAmount = doTransferIn(payer, repayAmountFinal);

        /*
         * We calculate the new borrower and total borrow balances, failing on underflow:
         *  accountBorrowsNew = accountBorrows - actualRepayAmount
         *  totalBorrowsNew = totalBorrows - actualRepayAmount
         */
        uint accountBorrowsNew = accountBorrowsPrev - actualRepayAmount;
        uint totalBorrowsNew = totalBorrows - actualRepayAmount;

        /* We write the previously calculated values into storage */
        accountBorrows[borrower].principal = accountBorrowsNew;
        accountBorrows[borrower].interestIndex = borrowIndex;
        totalBorrows = totalBorrowsNew;

        /* We emit a RepayBorrow event */
        emit RepayBorrow(payer, borrower, actualRepayAmount, accountBorrowsNew, totalBorrowsNew);

        return actualRepayAmount;
    }
```
The function `repayBorrowFresh` currently reduces the borrower's debt by the amount specified in the transaction, without checking if the actual amount received by the contract matches this amount. This issue is problematic when dealing with "weird" tokens like USDC and USDT, which may have fees on transfers, leading to discrepancies between the amount sent and the amount received.

Here is the relevant part of the current implementation:

```solidity
function _repayBorrowFresh(address payer, address borrower, uint256 amount, uint256 interest) internal {
    uint256 currTime = getTimestamp();
    if (currTime != accrualTimestamp) revert AccrueBlockParity();
    uint256 borrowedAmount = borrowBalanceStoredInternal(borrower);
    uint256 repayAmount = amount > borrowedAmount ? borrowedAmount : amount;
    if (repayAmount == 0) revert AmountZero();

    // (some lines omitted for brevity)
  // Update the account borrows to reflect the repayment

 @audit >> improper handling by protocol>>          accountBorrows[borrower].principal = borrowedAmount - repayAmount;
            accountBorrows[borrower].interest = 0;

    // (some lines omitted for brevity)

        uint256 sendAmount = decimalReducing(repayAmount, underlyingDecimal);

 @audit >> improper handling by protocol>>       IERC20Upgradeable(underlying).safeTransferFrom(payer, address(this), sendAmount);

    _depositToAssetManager(sendAmount);

    emit LogRepay(payer, borrower, sendAmount);
}
```

## Impact

The impact of this vulnerability is significant, as it allows users to reduce their debt by an amount larger than the actual tokens received by the contract. This discrepancy can lead to financial losses for the protocol and create inconsistencies in the accounting of borrowed funds.

## Example of Proper Handling (Mint Function)

In the `mint` function, the contract correctly handles the transferred amount by calculating the actual tokens received:

```solidity
function mint(uint256 amountIn) external override whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
    if (amountIn < minMintAmount) revert AmountError();
    if (!accrueInterest()) revert AccrueInterestFailed();
    uint256 exchangeRate = _exchangeRateStored();
    IERC20Upgradeable assetToken = IERC20Upgradeable(underlying);
 @audit >> proper handling by protocol>>   uint256 balanceBefore = assetToken.balanceOf(address(this));
@audit >> proper handling by protocol>>    assetToken.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amountIn);
@audit >> proper handling by protocol>>    uint256 balanceAfter = assetToken.balanceOf(address(this));
  @audit >> proper handling by protocol>>     uint256 actualObtained = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
    uint256 mintTokens = 0;
    uint256 totalAmount = decimalScaling(actualObtained, underlyingDecimal);
    uint256 mintFee = decimalScaling((actualObtained * mintFeeRate) / WAD, underlyingDecimal);
    if (mintFee > 0) {
        _totalReserves += mintFee;
    }
    uint256 mintAmount = totalAmount - mintFee;
    _totalRedeemable += mintAmount;
    mintTokens = (mintAmount * WAD) / exchangeRate;
    _mint(msg.sender, mintTokens);
    _depositToAssetManager(balanceAfter - balanceBefore);

    emit LogMint(msg.sender, mintAmount, mintTokens);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Refactor the `repayBorrowFresh` function to handle transferred funds properly, similar to the `mint` function. Ensure the contract correctly accounts for the actual amount received.

```solidity
function _repayBorrowFresh(address payer, address borrower, uint256 amount, uint256 interest) internal {
    uint256 currTime = getTimestamp();
    if (currTime != accrualTimestamp) revert AccrueBlockParity();
    uint256 borrowedAmount = borrowBalanceStoredInternal(borrower);
 IERC20Upgradeable assetToken = IERC20Upgradeable(underlying);
    uint256 balanceBefore = assetToken.balanceOf(address(this));
    assetToken.safeTransferFrom(payer, address(this),amount));
    uint256 balanceAfter = assetToken.balanceOf(address(this));
    uint256 actualReceived = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
    uint256 repayAmount = actualReceived > borrowedAmount ? borrowedAmount : actualReceived;
    if (repayAmount == 0) revert AmountZero();


    uint256 toReserveAmount;
    uint256 toRedeemableAmount;

    if (repayAmount >= interest) {
        toReserveAmount = (interest * reserveFactorMantissa) / WAD;
        toRedeemableAmount = interest - toReserveAmount;

        _totalBorrows -= (repayAmount - interest);
        accountBorrows[borrower].principal = borrowedAmount - repayAmount;
        accountBorrows[borrower].interest = 0;

        uint256 pastTime = currTime - getLastRepay(borrower);
        if (pastTime > overdueTime) {
            IUserManager(userManager).onRepayBorrow(borrower, getLastRepay(borrower) + overdueTime);
        }

        IUserManager(userManager).updateLocked(
            borrower,
            decimalReducing(repayAmount - interest, underlyingDecimal),
            false
        );

        if (_getBorrowed(borrower) == 0) {
            accountBorrows[borrower].lastRepay = 0;
        } else {
            accountBorrows[borrower].lastRepay = currTime;
        }
    } else {
        toReserveAmount = (repayAmount * reserveFactorMantissa) / WAD;
        toRedeemableAmount = repayAmount - toReserveAmount;
        accountBorrows[borrower].interest = interest - repayAmount;
    }

    _totalReserves += toReserveAmount;
    _totalRedeemable += toRedeemableAmount;

    accountBorrows[borrower].interestIndex = borrowIndex;

   
    
    _depositToAssetManager(repayAmount);

// refund msg.sender excess token
if (actualReceived > borrowedAmount ){
assetToken.safeTransfer(payer,actualReceived-borrowedAmount));
}


    emit LogRepay(payer, borrower, actualReceived);
}
```
