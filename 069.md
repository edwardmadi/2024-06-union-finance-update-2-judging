# Locking Withdrawal of Funds by Pausing Contract

## File Location
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-union-finance-update-2/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/user/UserManager.sol#L792

## Summary
Users cannot withdraw their own funds when the withdrawal function on the contract is paused. This causes user funds to be locked until the contract is reopened (unpaused), which can be considered unfair to users.

## Vulnerability Detail
On line 792, there is a _'withdrawRewards'_ function that uses the _'whenNotPaused'_ modifier. This means that when the contract is paused, users will not be able to call this function to withdraw their funds. This causes their funds to be locked in the contract until the contract is reopened (unpaused).

## Impact
- user distrust of systems and contracts
- liquidity for users who may need immediate access to their funds

## Code Snippet
L792
`    function withdrawRewards() external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {`

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Modify the contract to allow withdrawal of funds even when the contract is terminated. One way to do this is to separate the withdrawal function from the pausing mechanism, or by providing an alternative method for withdrawing funds that is not dependent on the termination status of the contract.
```solidity
function withdrawRewards() external nonReentrant {
    require(!paused() || msg.sender == owner, "Withdrawal of funds is not permitted when the contract is terminated except by the owner");
    // Fund withdrawal logic
}
```
In this way, withdrawals can still be made by users even if the contract is paused, but it is still possible to stop other functions that may be critical for security reasons.
