# `onERC1155BatchReceived` can be called by any address

## Summary
The `onERC1155BatchReceived` does not validate whether the `msg.sender` should be able to call the function, giving access to any contract to call it.

## Vulnerability Detail
Unlike `onERC1155BatchReceived`, `onERC1155Received` validates that the caller of the function is a valid token:

However, this check is missing in `onERC1155BatchReceived`:

As a result, any user can call `onERC1155BatchReceived` and have access to the `_vouchFor` function.

## Impact
As a result, a malicious user can increase the contract's vouch for any user, allowing them to make malicious borrows, stealing funds from the protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add validation to `onERC1155BatchReceived`:
```solidity
    function onERC1155BatchReceived(
        address operator,
        address from,
        uint256[] calldata ids,
        uint256[] calldata values,
        bytes calldata data
    ) external returns (bytes4) {
        require(isValidToken[msg.sender], "!valid token");
        _vouchFor(from);
        return bytes4(keccak256("onERC1155BatchReceived(address,address,uint256[],uint256[],bytes)"));
    }
```
