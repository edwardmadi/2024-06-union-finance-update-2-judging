# No access control on ERC1155Voucher::onERC1155BatchReceived()

### Summary

There is no check on `onERC1155BatchReceived()` in the ERC1155Voucher contract to ensure that the caller is a valid token similar to https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-union-finance-update-2/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/peripheral/ERC1155Voucher.sol#L109

Due to this vulnerability, any user can call the onERC1155BatchReceived() function to update trust for any borrower.



### Root Cause

The onERC1155BatchReceived() is not restricted, it is expected that the external call to this function is from an ERC1155 contract which has been pre-approved by the owner similar to the case in `onERC1155Received()`. However, such is not the case for the former, allowing any user to call the function and updatetrust for any borrower with the ERC1155Voucher as the staker.
