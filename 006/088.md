# `repayBorrowWithERC20Permit` supplies incorrect interest value to `_repayBorrowFresh`

## Summary
The `UErc20.sol` `repayBorrowWithERC20Permit` and `UDai.sol` `repayBorrowWithPermit` call `_repayBorrowFresh`, supplying `calculatingInterest(borrower)` as the interest parameter. The issue is that `calculatingInterest(borrower)` returns the reduced decimal version of the interest, while the `_repayBorrowFresh` function expects the value to be scaled to 18 decimals. As a result, for USDC and USDT, that have 6 decimals, the interest will be significantly less.

## Vulnerability Detail
As we can see from the `repayBorrowWithERC20Permit` function:

`calculatingInterest(borrower)` is supplied to `_repayBorrowFresh`, however `calculatingInterest` returns the following:
```solidity
 return decimalReducing(_calculatingInterest(account), underlyingDecimal);
```

This is incorrect as `_repayBorrowFresh` expects the value to be scaled to 18 decimals. In the other occurences that `_repayBorrowFresh` is called, it uses the internal function `_calculatingInterest(account)`, which does not reduce the decimals of the interest:

## Impact
As a result of the wrong interest being supplied borrowers will be able to reduce their interest to 0, while only paying for a fraction of the actual interest. This will occur as the interest they will be paying for will be presented in 6 decimals, when it should be in 18 decimals. Thus, they will be stealing funds from the protocol and other users.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In `repayBorrowWithERC20Permit` scale the result of `calculatingInterest` to 18 decimals:
```solidity
_repayBorrowFresh(msg.sender, borrower, decimalScaling(amount, underlyingDecimal), decimalScaling(interest, underlyingDecimal));
```
