# Interest amount is not scaled which can cause various accounting issues.

## Summary
As the codebase intends to work with usdc and usdt which have less than 18 decimals so the input amount is needed to scaled to 18 decimals but wrong function is called for calculating the interest which causes incorrect updation of key variables.
## Vulnerability Detail
Following is repayBorrowWithERC20Permit function which is used to repay the borrowed amount.
```solidity
function repayBorrowWithERC20Permit(
        address borrower,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 deadline,
        uint8 v,
        bytes32 r,
        bytes32 s
    ) external whenNotPaused {
        IERC20Permit erc20Token = IERC20Permit(underlying);
        erc20Token.permit(msg.sender, address(this), amount, deadline, v, r, s);

        if (!accrueInterest()) revert AccrueInterestFailed();
        uint256 interest = calculatingInterest(borrower);
        _repayBorrowFresh(msg.sender, borrower, decimalScaling(amount, underlyingDecimal), interest);
    }
```
The error is the usage of  calculatingInterest(borrower) function because this function essentially returns interest in terms of underlying decimals whereas interest value returned should be in 18 decimals.

```solidity
 function calculatingInterest(address account) public view override returns (uint256) {
        return decimalReducing(_calculatingInterest(account), underlyingDecimal);
    }
```
All other repay functions use _calculatingInterest(account) function in order to calculate the interest because it returns the value in 18 decimals as can be seen below.
```solidity
function repayInterest(address borrower) external override whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
        if (!accrueInterest()) revert AccrueInterestFailed();
        uint256 interest = _calculatingInterest(borrower);
        _repayBorrowFresh(msg.sender, borrower, interest, interest);
    }

    /**
     * @notice Repay outstanding borrow
     * @dev Repay borrow see _repayBorrowFresh
     */
    function repayBorrow(address borrower, uint256 amount) external override whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
        if (!accrueInterest()) revert AccrueInterestFailed();
        uint256 actualAmount = decimalScaling(amount, underlyingDecimal);
        uint256 interest = _calculatingInterest(borrower);
        _repayBorrowFresh(msg.sender, borrower, actualAmount, interest);
    }
```

## Impact
Impact is incorrect updation of _totalBorrows variable. Not only this,user can also get away by repaying less amount because of the following if condition 
if (repayAmount >= interest)  because repay amount would in 18 decimals whereas interest would be in less than 18 decimals.(in case of usdc and usdt it would be in 6 decimals.) so even by paying a very less amount user can repay their interest.
```solidity
 function _repayBorrowFresh(address payer, address borrower, uint256 amount, uint256 interest) internal {
        uint256 currTime = getTimestamp();
        if (currTime != accrualTimestamp) revert AccrueBlockParity();
        uint256 borrowedAmount = borrowBalanceStoredInternal(borrower);
        uint256 repayAmount = amount > borrowedAmount ? borrowedAmount : amount;
        if (repayAmount == 0) revert AmountZero();

        uint256 toReserveAmount;
        uint256 toRedeemableAmount;

        if (repayAmount >= interest) {
            // Interest is split between the reserves and the uToken minters based on
            // the reserveFactorMantissa When set to WAD all the interest is paid to teh reserves.
            // any interest that isn't sent to the reserves is added to the redeemable amount
            // and can be redeemed by uToken minters.
            toReserveAmount = (interest * reserveFactorMantissa) / WAD;
            toRedeemableAmount = interest - toReserveAmount;

            // Update the total borrows to reduce by the amount of principal that has
            // been paid off
            _totalBorrows -= (repayAmount - interest);

            // Update the account borrows to reflect the repayment
            accountBorrows[borrower].principal = borrowedAmount - repayAmount;
            accountBorrows[borrower].interest = 0;

            uint256 pastTime = currTime - getLastRepay(borrower);
            if (pastTime > overdueTime) {
                // For borrowers that are paying back overdue balances we need to update their
                // frozen balance and the global total frozen balance on the UserManager
                IUserManager(userManager).onRepayBorrow(borrower, getLastRepay(borrower) + overdueTime);
            }

            // Call update locked on the userManager to lock this borrowers stakers. This function
            // will revert if the account does not have enough vouchers to cover the repay amount. ie
            // the borrower is trying to repay more than is locked (owed)
            IUserManager(userManager).updateLocked(
                borrower,
                decimalReducing(repayAmount - interest, underlyingDecimal),
                false
            );

            if (_getBorrowed(borrower) == 0) {
                // If the principal is now 0 we can reset the last repaid time to 0.
                // which indicates that the borrower has no outstanding loans.
                accountBorrows[borrower].lastRepay = 0;
            } else {
                // Save the current block timestamp as last repaid
                accountBorrows[borrower].lastRepay = currTime;
            }
        } else {
            // For repayments that don't pay off the minimum we just need to adjust the
            // global balances and reduce the amount of interest accrued for the borrower
            toReserveAmount = (repayAmount * reserveFactorMantissa) / WAD;
            toRedeemableAmount = repayAmount - toReserveAmount;
            accountBorrows[borrower].interest = interest - repayAmount;
        }

        _totalReserves += toReserveAmount;
        _totalRedeemable += toRedeemableAmount;

        accountBorrows[borrower].interestIndex = borrowIndex;

        // Transfer underlying token that have been repaid and then deposit
        // then in the asset manager so they can be distributed between the
        // underlying money markets
        uint256 sendAmount = decimalReducing(repayAmount, underlyingDecimal);
        IERC20Upgradeable(underlying).safeTransferFrom(payer, address(this), sendAmount);
        _depositToAssetManager(sendAmount);

        emit LogRepay(payer, borrower, sendAmount);
    }

## Recommendation
instead of calculatingInterest() function use _calculatingInterest() function.
