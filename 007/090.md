# `debtWriteOff` incorrectly reduces `_totalStaked`, causing rewards to be inaccurate

## Summary
`UserManager.sol`'s `debtWriteOff` function writes off a borrower's debt. The issue is that when it subtracts the amount written off from the `_totalStaked` variable it removes a value that is not scaled to 18 decimals.

## Vulnerability Detail
As we can see from the `debtWriteOff` function, it subtracts `amount` from `_totalStaked`:
```solidity
_totalStaked -= amount;
```

The issue is that in the specific case, `amount` is not scaled to 18 decimals, and when USDC and USDT are used it will be a 6 decimal value. This is a problem as `_totalStaked`  is always increased/decreased by a value that is scaled to 18 decimals:

Therefore, when debt is written off, `_totalStaked` will be more than it actually should be, causing `globalTotalStaked` and `totalStaked` to return wrong values.

## Impact
As `_totalStaked` is used when rewards are calculated in the `Comptroller.sol` `calculateRewards` function, UnionToken rewards will be higher than intended by the protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In `debtWriteOff` subtract `actualAmount` from `_totalStaked`:

```solidity
_totalStaked -= actualAmount;
```
