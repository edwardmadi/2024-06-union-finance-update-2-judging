# Lack of Event Emission Issue key Functions

## Summary
The `mapTokenToAToken` function in the contract lacks an event emission to notify external parties of the mapping between a token and its corresponding `aToken`. .

Also  the `withdraw`Function in the contract lacks an emisson.


## Vulnerability Detail
The `mapTokenToAToken` function does not emit an event after updating the `tokenToAToken` mapping. This makes it difficult for external parties to track and monitor changes to the token-aToken mapping.

The `withdraw` function does not emit an event after withdrawing tokens to the receiver address. This makes it difficult for external parties to track and monitor changes.
## Impact
The lack of event emission makes it harder to monitor and audit changes to the token-aToken mapping, potentially leading to issues with external integrations or data tracking.

```solidity
   /**
     * @dev Add aToken to the token mapping for a supported token
     * @param tokenAddress Token address
     */
    function mapTokenToAToken(address tokenAddress) external onlyAdmin {
        LendingPool3.ReserveData memory reserveData = lendingPool.getReserveData(tokenAddress);
        IERC20Upgradeable token = IERC20Upgradeable(tokenAddress);

        address spender = address(lendingPool);
        uint256 currentAllowance = token.allowance(address(this), spender);
        if (currentAllowance < type(uint256).max) {
            token.safeIncreaseAllowance(spender, type(uint256).max - currentAllowance);
        }

        tokenToAToken[tokenAddress] = reserveData.aTokenAddress;
    }
```


```solidity
 /**
     * @dev Withdraw tokens from this adapter
     * @dev Only callable by the AssetManager
     * @param tokenAddress Token to withdraw
     * @param recipient Received by
     * @param tokenAmount Amount of tokens to withdraw
     */
    function withdraw(
        address tokenAddress,
        address recipient,
        uint256 tokenAmount
    ) external override onlyAssetManager checkTokenSupported(tokenAddress) returns (bool) {
        if (_checkBal(tokenAddress)) {
            try lendingPool.withdraw(tokenAddress, tokenAmount, recipient) {
                return true;
            } catch {
                return false;
            }
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add an event emission at the end of the mapTokenToAToken function to notify external parties of the token-aToken mapping update:
```solidity
emit LogTokenMappedToAToken(tokenAddress, reserveData.aTokenAddress);
```

```solidity
emit Withdraw(recipient, tokenAmount);
```
