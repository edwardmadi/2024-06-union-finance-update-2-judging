# Upgradeable Contract Not Initialized

## File Location
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-union-finance-update-2/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/user/UserManager.sol#L25

## Summary
Upgradable contracts are initialized via an initialization function instead of using a constructor. If such contracts are not initialized, they can be taken over by malicious users.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the _'UserManager'_ contract in _'user/UserManager.sol'_ on line 25, it is found that this contract is an upgradeable contract which is initialized using the initialization function (_'initializer'_). However, there is no evidence that this initialization function has been called.

## Impact
Malicious users can call the initialization function and set themselves as the owner or admin of the contract. This allows them to take over contracts and perform detrimental actions, such as stealing assets or changing contract logic.

## Code Snippet
L25
`contract UserManager is Controller, IUserManager, ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable, ScaledDecimalBase {`

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
ensure that the initialization function is called immediately after the contract is deployed. The following is an example of an initialization function that can be added to a contract:
```solidity
function initialize() public initializer {
    __ReentrancyGuard_init();
    // Variable initialization and other settings
}
```
Additionally, make sure to call this _'initialize'_ function immediately after the contract is deployed, as in the deployment script:
```solidity
const userManager = await UserManager.deploy();
await userManager.initialize();
```
