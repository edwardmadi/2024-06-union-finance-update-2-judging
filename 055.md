# Vulnerable to Token Fee-on-Transfer Accounting Issues

## File Location
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-union-finance-update-2/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/user/UserManagerOp.sol#L16-L22

## Summary
The _'registerMember'_ function in the _'UserManagerOp.sol'_ contract is vulnerable to accounting issues related to tokens with a fee-on-transfer mechanism. This function does not verify the number of tokens received after transfer, which may cause inaccuracies in token transfers when fees are charged.

## Vulnerability Detail
Without measuring the balance before and after the transfer, there is no way to ensure that a sufficient number of tokens have been transferred in cases where the tokens have a fee-on-transfer mechanism. This means that when there are latent funds in the contract, subsequent transfers will be successful even if the actual number of tokens received is less than expected.

## Impact
- financial loss
- distrust of the system

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function registerMember(address newMember) public override whenNotPaused {
        _validateNewMember(newMember);


        IERC20Upgradeable(unionToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(comptroller), newMemberFee);


        emit LogRegisterMember(msg.sender, newMember);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To overcome this problem, it is necessary to verify the balance before and after the transfer to ensure that the expected number of tokens is actually received. The following are recommended improvements:
```solidity
function registerMember(address newMember) public override whenNotPaused {
    _validateNewMember(newMember);

    uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20Upgradeable(unionToken).balanceOf(address(comptroller));
    IERC20Upgradeable(unionToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(comptroller), newMemberFee);
    uint256 balanceAfter = IERC20Upgradeable(unionToken).balanceOf(address(comptroller));

    require(balanceAfter == balanceBefore + newMemberFee, "Transfer amount mismatch");

    emit LogRegisterMember(msg.sender, newMember);
}
```
