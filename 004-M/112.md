# DOS attack while using `repayBorrowWithPermit()`

## Summary
- DOS attack while using `repayBorrowWithPermit()`

## Vulnerability Detail
- ERC20Permit uses the nonces mapping for replay protection. Once a signature is verified and approved, the nonce increases, invalidating the same signature being replayed.
`repayBorrowWithPermit()` expects the holder to sign their tokens and provide the signature to contract as part of permitData.
- When a `repayBorrowWithPermit()` transaction is in the mempool, an attacker can take this signature, call the permit function on the token themselves.
- Since this is a valid signature, the token accepts it and increases the nonce.
- This makes the spender's transaction fail whenever it gets mined.
## Impact
- Attacker can make sure all calls to `repayBorrowWithPermit()` fail.
- Normal user have to pay more interest as due to increase of block.number

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- In `repayBorrowWithPermit()` function, check if it has the approval it needs. If not, then only submit the permit signature.
- Now even if attacker call the permit function on the token themselves before the user then also the function would work properly and no revert would be thrown.
