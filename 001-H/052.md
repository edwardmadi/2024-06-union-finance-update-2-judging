# Non-Updating Claimed Tokens (`claimedTokens[token][msg.sender]`) in `VouchFaucet` Contract Allowing an attacker to drain the contract

## Summary
The `VouchFaucet` contract does not properly update the `claimedTokens` mapping after each token claim, leading to inaccurate tracking of the total claimed amount for users.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `claimTokens` function, the `claimedTokens[token][msg.sender]` value is not updated after a token claim. As a result, this value remains zero, preventing users from claiming additional tokens and potentially causing confusion or misuse of the claiming mechanism.

## Impact
This issue allow users to exploit the claiming function by bypassing the intended limitations on claims and drain the contract

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Ensure that the `claimedTokens[token][msg.sender]` mapping is updated correctly after each successful token claim. This will allow for accurate tracking of the claimed amounts and maintain the integrity of the claiming process.
