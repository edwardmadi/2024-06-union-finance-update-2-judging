# Wrong check used in claimTokens function in vouchFacet contract.

## Summary
Wrong check used in claimTokens function in vouchFacet contract which causes users to claim tokens beyond the maxClaimable limit.
## Vulnerability Detail
Following is the claimtokens function 
```solidity
function claimTokens(address token, uint256 amount) external {
        require(claimedTokens[token][msg.sender] <= maxClaimable[token], "amount>max");
        IERC20(token).transfer(msg.sender, amount);
        emit TokensClaimed(msg.sender, token, amount);
    }
```
As can be seen from above if the value of claimedTokens[token][msg.sender] = maxClaimable[token] then user has reached its limit and thus it should not be allowed to claim any more tokens but a user can claim more tokens because the above function doesn't takes into account the amount of tokens the user is about to claim in this function call.
## Impact
User can claim more tokens than the intended limit.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Make the following change in the require condition
```solidity
require(claimedTokens[token][msg.sender] +amount <= maxClaimable[token], "amount>max");
```
