# External Calls in Modifiers

## File Location
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-union-finance-update-2/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/OpOwner.sol#L26

## Summary
The use of external calls in modifiers can introduce reentrancy risks and make the contract logic less transparent. Modifiers should only be used for pre-execution checks, and external calls to them can cause unexpected flow and potential reentrancy issues.

## Vulnerability Detail
On line 26, there is an external call in the _'onlyAuth'_ modifier. In this modifier, there is a call to _'ovmL2CrossDomainMessenger.xDomainMessageSender()'_. These external calls can leave the contract vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.

## Impact
- Reentrancy risk
- Lack of transparency

## Code Snippet
L26
`                    ovmL2CrossDomainMessenger.xDomainMessageSender() == owner())`

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To reduce this risk, it is recommended to avoid external calls in modifiers and move them directly into the function body. Here is an example of a fix:
```solidity
function someFunction() external onlyAuth {
    require(
        msg.sender == admin() ||
            (msg.sender == address(ovmL2CrossDomainMessenger) &&
                ovmL2CrossDomainMessenger.xDomainMessageSender() == owner())
    );
    // other function logic
}
```
In this way, the execution flow becomes clearer and easier to understand, and the risk of reentrancy can be minimized.
