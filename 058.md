# Return Value of Function 'approve()' Not Checked

## File location
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-union-finance-update-2/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/peripheral/VouchFaucet.sol#L62-L63

## Summary
Some implementations of the _'IERC20'_ interface do not always use the _'revert()'_ function when a failure occurs in the _'approve()'_ function. Instead, they use a boolean return value to indicate an error. By not checking the return value, operations that should fail can pass without actually providing any approval.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the file _'VouchFaucet.sol'_ on lines 62 and 63, there is a call to the _'approve()'_ function of the _'IERC20'_ interface without checking the boolean return value of the function. This could potentially cause failed approval operations to go undetected and be considered successful.

## Impact
- failure in transfer
- potential loss

## Code Snippet
```solidity
        IERC20(stakingToken).approve(_userManager, 0);
        IERC20(stakingToken).approve(_userManager, type(uint256).max);

```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check the boolean return value of the _'approve()'_ function to ensure that the approval operation was successful before proceeding to the next operation.
