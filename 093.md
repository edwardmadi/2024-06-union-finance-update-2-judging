# }incorrect version of ownable library can malfunction the onlyowner functions

### Summary

usage of incorrect version of ownable can malfunction the onlyowner function Based on the context and comments in the code, the contract is designed to be deployed as an upgradeable proxy contract.

However, the current implementaion is using an non-upgradeable version of the Ownbale library: @openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol instead of the upgradeable version: @openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/access/OwnableUpgradeable.sol.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

A regular, non-upgradeable Ownbale library will make the deployer the default owner in the constructor. Due to a requirement of the proxy-based upgradeability system, no constructors can be used in upgradeable contracts. Therefore, there will be no owner when the contract is deployed as a proxy contract.
As a result, all the onlyOwner functions will be inaccessible.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use @openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/access/OwnableUpgradeable.sol and @openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol instead.
