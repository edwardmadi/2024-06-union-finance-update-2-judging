# Incorrect Claim Check in `VouchFaucet` Contract Cuase anybody can drain the contract

## Summary
The `VouchFaucet` contract contains an incorrect requirement check in the `claimTokens` function, which could allow users to claim more tokens than they are entitled to.

## Vulnerability Detail

The current check in the `claimTokens` function is as follows:

```solidity
require(claimedTokens[token][msg.sender] <= maxClaimable[token], "amount>max");
```

The current check in the `claimTokens` function only verifies that the total claimed amount for the user is less than or equal to the maximum claimable amount, without accounting for the new amount being claimed.

## Impact
This oversight allows users to potentially claim more tokens than allowed, which can lead to incorrect token distribution and affect the overall integrity of the contract's functionality.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change the requirement check in the `claimTokens` function to properly include the new amount being claimed. 

```diff
    function claimTokens(address token, uint256 amount) external {
-       require(claimedTokens[token][msg.sender] <= maxClaimable[token], "amount>max");
+       require(claimedTokens[token][msg.sender] + amount <= maxClaimable[token], "amount exceeds max");
        IERC20(token).transfer(msg.sender, amount);
        emit TokensClaimed(msg.sender, token, amount);
    }
```

This adjustment will ensure that the total claimed amount does not exceed the maximum claimable limit for the user.
