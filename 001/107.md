# Lack of Whitelisting Mechanism in VouchFaucet Contract

## Summary
The `VouchFaucet` contract does not implement a whitelisting mechanism to restrict access to the `claimTokens` function. This allows any address to claim tokens up to the maximum limit, potentially leading to abuse by attackers who generate multiple addresses to drain the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `claimTokens` function can be called by any address, with no checks to verify if the address is authorized to claim tokens. This lack of access control can be exploited by attackers who generate multiple addresses to repeatedly claim tokens, thereby draining the contract's token reserves.

## Impact
Attackers can generate multiple addresses to repeatedly claim tokens up to the `maxClaimable` limit, eventually draining the contract and depleting the token reserves intended for legitimate users.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a whitelisting mechanism to restrict access to the `claimTokens` function. Only authorized addresses should be able to call this function. This can be achieved by maintaining a mapping of whitelisted addresses and adding checks in the `claimTokens` function to ensure only whitelisted addresses can claim tokens.
