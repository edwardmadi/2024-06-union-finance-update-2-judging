# Maxclaimable token by msg.sender(user) in  Vouch Faucet can be bypassed due to insufficient check.

## Summary

The `claimTokens` function in the Vouch Faucet contract allows users to bypass the maximum claimable token limit due to an insufficient check. This vulnerability enables users to claim all available funds in the contract, even if it exceeds their individual cap, leading to potential depletion of the contract's funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `claimTokens` function is intended to restrict each user to claiming a certain amount of tokens up to a predefined cap. However, the current implementation only checks if the already claimed amount is less than or equal to the available amount in the contract. This allows a user who has nearly reached their cap to claim all remaining tokens in the contract without considering their personal cap.

### Problematic Code Snippet

```solidity
function claimTokens(address token, uint256 amount) external {
    require(claimedTokens[token][msg.sender] <= maxClaimable[token], "amount>max");
    IERC20(token).transfer(msg.sender, amount);
    emit TokensClaimed(msg.sender, token, amount);
}
```
In the current implementation, the check `require(claimedTokens[token][msg.sender] <= maxClaimable[token], "amount>max");` is insufficient because it does not account for the amount being claimed in the current transaction. This allows users to bypass their individual caps.

### Example

- If a user's cap is $20,000 and they have already claimed $19,000, they can request to claim an additional $100,000. The current check will pass because $19,000 is less than $100,000, and the transfer will proceed, allowing the user to exceed their cap.

## Impact

The impact of this vulnerability includes:
- Users being able to claim more than their maximum allowed tokens, potentially draining the contract of all its funds.
- Unfair distribution of tokens among users, as some users may claim significantly more than their fair share.
- Financial losses for the contract and other users due to the depletion of funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To mitigate this issue, the check should be updated to ensure the total claimed amount, including the current claim, does not exceed the user's cap. The corrected implementation should be:

```solidity
function claimTokens(address token, uint256 amount) external {
    require(claimedTokens[token][msg.sender] + amount <= maxClaimable[token], "amount>max");
    claimedTokens[token][msg.sender] += amount;
    IERC20(token).transfer(msg.sender, amount);
}
```
