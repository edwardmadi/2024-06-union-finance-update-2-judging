# Missing Implementation Contract Initialization Disabling

## Summary
The contract fails to call `_disableInitializer()` in its constructor, potentially allowing direct initialization of the implementation contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
In upgradeable contracts, it's crucial to prevent the implementation contract from being initialized directly. This is typically done by calling _disableInitializer() in the constructor of the implementation contract. However, this call is missing in the current implementation.
## Impact
The implementation contract could potentially be initialized directly

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a constructor to the contract that calls _disableInitializer():
Add this
```solidity
constructor() {
    _disableInitializer();
}
```
