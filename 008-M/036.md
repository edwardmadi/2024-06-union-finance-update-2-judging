# Users can borrow below the minBorrow limit because of a bypass caused by remainder being greater than 0.

## Summary

Users can borrow below the `minBorrow` limit due to a bypass caused by the remainder being greater than 0. The current `minBorrow` check only verifies the initial amount requested by the user, but fails to ensure the amount sent by the `assetManager` is above the `minBorrow` limit. This can lead to scenarios where the final borrowed amount is below the `minBorrow` limit.


## Vulnerability Detail

In the borrow function, the `minBorrow` check is performed on the initial amount requested by the user. However, this check does not account for the actual amount sent by the `assetManager` after withdrawal, which can be lower than the requested.

 The code snippet responsible for this is:

```solidity
// Withdraw the borrowed amount of tokens from the assetManager and send them to the borrower
uint256 remaining = assetManagerContract.withdraw(underlying, to, amount);
if (remaining > amount) revert WithdrawFailed();
actualAmount -= decimalScaling(remaining, underlyingDecimal);
```
A user can borrow the minBorrow amount but if remainder is greater than 0 this values drops below the minBorrow.
If the remaining amount is greater than 0, it can reduce the `actualAmount` to below the `minBorrow` limit. Since there is no subsequent check to ensure the `actualAmount` is still above the `minBorrow` limit, users can end up borrowing less than the minimum required amount.


## Impact

The impact of this vulnerability is that users can unintentionally or maliciously bypass the `minBorrow` limit, leading to borrowed amounts that are lower than the protocol's intended minimum.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To prevent this vulnerability, an additional check should be added after the funds have been sent by the `assetManager` to ensure the `actualAmount` is still above the `minBorrow` limit. The updated code should look like this:

```solidity
function borrow(uint256 amount) external {
    // Initial minBorrow check
    if (amount < _minBorrow) revert AmountLessMinBorrow();

    // Withdraw the borrowed amount of tokens from the assetManager and send them to the borrower
    uint256 remaining = assetManagerContract.withdraw(underlying, to, amount);
    if (remaining > amount) revert WithdrawFailed();
    actualAmount -= decimalScaling(remaining, underlyingDecimal);

        // Additional minBorrow check after withdrawal
++    if (actualAmount < _minBorrow) revert AmountLessMinBorrow();
}
```
