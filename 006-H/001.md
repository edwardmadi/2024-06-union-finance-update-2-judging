## Recommendation
modifier onlyAllowed{ 

   //what accounts are allowed to claim tokens
  _;

}
function claimTokens(address token, uint256 amount) external onlyAllowed{
        require(claimedTokens[token][msg.sender] +amount <= maxClaimable[token], "amount>max");
        claimedTokens[token][msg.sender] =  claimedTokens[token][msg.sender] +amount;
        IERC20(token).transfer(msg.sender, amount);
        emit TokensClaimed(msg.sender, token, amount);
    }
