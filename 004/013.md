# Funds can be stuck in AssetManager when all money markets are unavailable

## Summary
The `deposit `function in the `AssetManager `contract has a critical vulnerability where user funds can become stuck if all integrated money markets are unavailable or at capacity. The function does not revert in this scenario, instead returning success and emitting a deposit event, potentially misleading users and the system about the state of their funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `deposit `function attempts to deposit user funds into available money markets based on floor and ceiling constraints. However, it lacks a crucial check to ensure that funds are actually deposited somewhere before considering the operation successful.
The function uses a remaining `boolean` to track whether the deposit has been successful, but this flag is never checked at the end of the function. As a result, even if no suitable money market is found and the funds remain in the `AssetManager` contract, the function will still return `true`and emit a `LogDeposit `event.
This can occur when

* All money markets have reached their ceilings  and floor for the token.

## Impact
* User funds becoming stuck in the AssetManager contract, not generating any yield.
* Misleading accounting, where the system believes funds are deployed when they are not.
* Potential loss of funds if there's no mechanism to retrieve stuck tokens.

PoC

```solidity

 function testDeposit(uint256 amount) public {
        vm.assume(amount != 0 && amount < erc20Amount);
        vm.startPrank(ADMIN);
        adapterMock.setCeiling(address(erc20Mock), 0); // This is set to set to show there is no market available
        adapterMock.setFloor(address(erc20Mock), 0);//  This is set to set to show there is no market available
        setTokens(address(this), address(123));
        vm.stopPrank();
        assetManager.deposit(address(erc20Mock), amount);
      
    }
```

result: It still goes through and doesn't revert.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To address this vulnerability, consider implementing the following changes:

Add a check at the end of the function to ensure the deposit was successful:

```solidity 
require(!remaining, "Deposit failed: No suitable money market found");
```
