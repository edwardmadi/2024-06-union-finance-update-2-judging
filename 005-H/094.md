# In debtWriteOff function _totalStaked variable is reduced by unscaled amount.

## Summary
In debtWriteOff function _totalStaked variable is reduced by unscaled amount which causes wrong updation of _totalStaked variable.
## Vulnerability Detail
Following is the In debtWriteOff function
```solidity
    function debtWriteOff(address stakerAddress, address borrowerAddress, uint256 amount) external {
        if (amount == 0) revert AmountZero();
        uint256 actualAmount = decimalScaling(amount, stakingTokenDecimal);
        uint256 overdueTime = uToken.overdueTime();
        uint256 lastRepay = uToken.getLastRepay(borrowerAddress);
        uint256 currTime = getTimestamp();

        // This function is only callable by the public if the loan is overdue by
        // overdue time + maxOverdueTime. This stops the system being left with
        // debt that is overdue indefinitely and no ability to do anything about it.
        if (currTime <= lastRepay + overdueTime + maxOverdueTime) {
            if (stakerAddress != msg.sender) revert AuthFailed();
        }

        Index memory index = voucherIndexes[borrowerAddress][stakerAddress];
        if (!index.isSet) revert VoucherNotFound();
        Vouch storage vouch = _vouchers[borrowerAddress][index.idx];
        uint256 locked = vouch.locked;
        if (actualAmount > locked) revert ExceedsLocked();

        comptroller.accrueRewards(stakerAddress, stakingToken);

        Staker storage staker = _stakers[stakerAddress];

        staker.stakedAmount -= actualAmount.toUint96();
        staker.locked -= actualAmount.toUint96();
        staker.lastUpdated = currTime.toUint64();
==>     _totalStaked -= amount;

        // update vouch trust amount
        vouch.trust -= actualAmount.toUint96();
        vouch.locked -= actualAmount.toUint96();
        vouch.lastUpdated = currTime.toUint64();

        // Update total frozen and member frozen. We don't want to move th
        // burden of calling updateFrozenInfo into this function as it is quite
        // gas intensive. Instead we just want to remove the actualAmount that was
        // frozen which is now being written off. However, it is possible that
        // member frozen has not been updated prior to calling debtWriteOff and
        // the actualAmount being written off could be greater than the actualAmount frozen.
        // To avoid an underflow here we need to check this condition
        uint256 stakerFrozen = _memberFrozen[stakerAddress];
        if (actualAmount > stakerFrozen) {
            // The actualAmount being written off is more than the actualAmount that has
            // been previously frozen for this staker. Reset their frozen stake
            // to zero and adjust _totalFrozen
            _memberFrozen[stakerAddress] = 0;
            _totalFrozen -= stakerFrozen;
        } else {
            _totalFrozen -= actualAmount;
            _memberFrozen[stakerAddress] -= actualAmount;
        }

        if (vouch.trust == 0) {
            _cancelVouchInternal(stakerAddress, borrowerAddress);
        }

        // Notify the AssetManager and the UToken market of the debt write off
        // so they can adjust their balances accordingly
        IAssetManager(assetManager).debtWriteOff(stakingToken, amount);
        uToken.debtWriteOff(borrowerAddress, amount);
        emit LogDebtWriteOff(msg.sender, borrowerAddress, amount);
    }
```
As can be seen from the line  _totalStaked -= amount;  it is clear that the _totalStaked value is decreased by unscaled amount thus it causes _totalStaked value to reduce by a way less number than it really should be reduced by.

## Impact
As _totalStaked variable is used in the calculation of rewards for the stakers in comptroller contract it causes wrong calculation of the rewards thus high severity.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
reduce the _totalStaked value as follows
_totalStaked -= actualAmount.toUint96();
