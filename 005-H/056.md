# Wrong accounting of `_totalStaked` in `UserManager.debtWriteOff`

## Summary
In `UserManager.debtWriteOff`, the state variable `_totalStaked` is updated with an incorrect un-scaled value.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `UserManager.debtWriteOff`, the state variable `_totalStaked` should be updated by the scaled value `actualAmount`, but instead is updated with the value `amount`:
[UserManager.sol#L834](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-union-finance-update-2/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/user/UserManager.sol#L834)
 ```solidity
        _totalStaked -= amount;
 ```
 
Everywhere else in the code `_totalStaked` is updated with scaled values, for instance in the `stake` function:
[UserManager.sol#L748](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-union-finance-update-2/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/user/UserManager.sol#L748)
 ```solidity
        _totalStaked += actualAmount;
 ```
 

## Impact
The `_totalStaked` variable is used in the Comptroller contract which calls `UserManager.globalTotalStaked` to update the inflation index. During the update, the `_lookup` function is called which depends on the value of `_totalStaked`.

In case of a low decimal staking token, a very low value will be subtracted to `_totalStaked` which will maintain the inflation per second at an abnormaly high value compared to the one with real total staked amount. For a high decimal token (greater than 18), the effect will be the opposite.

This issue directly leads to rewards not being calculated correctly. Thus, I believe this issue to be of high severity.
