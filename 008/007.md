# Unaccounted Token Transfers Lead to Withdrawal Sequence Disruption and Potential Fund Loss

## Summary
The `AssetManager` contract is vulnerable to direct token transfers, which can disrupt its withdrawal mechanism and yield generation strategy. This vulnerability can lead to users losing funds through mistaken transfers or allow malicious actors to interfere with the contract's operations.
## Vulnerability Detail
* The `withdraw `function in the `AssetManager ` contract prioritizes withdrawing from its own balance before interacting with money markets. However, it doesn't distinguish between intentional deposits and direct token transfers to the contract address. This can lead to two main issues:

* Users who mistakenly send tokens directly to the contract may lose their funds permanently.
An attacker can intentionally inflate the contract's balance, disrupting its interaction with money markets and potentially reducing yield generation for all users.
## Impact
* Loss of user funds through mistaken direct transfers
* Disruption of the contract's yield generation strategy
* Potential for excess withdrawals if internal accounting is not properly managed
* Unintended increase in the protocol's assets, leading to discrepancies between actual and accounted balances

AssetManager contract has 200 tokens in its balance and 800 in money markets.
Attacker sends 1000 tokens directly to the contract address.
User requests withdrawal of 1200 tokens.
Contract fulfills the entire withdrawal from its own balance (200 + 1000) without touching money markets.
This disrupts the intended withdrawal sequence and yield generation strategy.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a separate accounting mechanism for unexpected token transfers:

We can also  add a `recovertoken function` just like the one in #6 
```solidity
mapping(address => uint256) public excessBalance;

function updateBalance(address token) internal {
    uint256 actualBalance = IERC20Upgradeable(token).balanceOf(address(this));
    uint256 expectedBalance = totalPrincipal[token];
    if (actualBalance > expectedBalance) {
        excessBalance[token] = actualBalance - expectedBalance;
    }
}
```
