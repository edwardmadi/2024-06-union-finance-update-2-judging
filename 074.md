# users can not repay their debts if repay functions are paused and would need to pay forced debt incured during pause period

## Summary
users can not repay their debts if repay functions are paused and would need to pay forced debt incured during pause period

## Vulnerability Detail
The following `Union` contracts have repay functions which allows a borrower to repay debt. 

1) `UDai.repayBorrowWithPermit()`:

```solidity
    function repayBorrowWithPermit(
        address borrower,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 nonce,
        uint256 expiry,
        uint8 v,
        bytes32 r,
        bytes32 s
    ) external whenNotPaused {

       . . . some code . . . 

        uint256 interest = calculatingInterest(borrower);
        _repayBorrowFresh(msg.sender, borrower, decimalScaling(amount, underlyingDecimal), interest);
    }
```

2) `UErc20.repayBorrowWithERC20Permit()`:

```solidity
    function repayBorrowWithERC20Permit(
        address borrower,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 deadline,
        uint8 v,
        bytes32 r,
        bytes32 s
    ) external whenNotPaused {

       . . . some code . . . 

        uint256 interest = calculatingInterest(borrower);
        _repayBorrowFresh(msg.sender, borrower, decimalScaling(amount, underlyingDecimal), interest);
    }
```

3) `UToken.repayBorrow()`:

```solidity
    function repayBorrow(address borrower, uint256 amount) external override whenNotPaused nonReentrant {

       . . . some code . . . 

        uint256 interest = _calculatingInterest(borrower);
        _repayBorrowFresh(msg.sender, borrower, actualAmount, interest);
    }
```

All of the above function has implemented the `whenNotPaused` modifier, which will prevent the function from being used if the contract is paused.

The problem is that the usage of these repay functions should not be prevented because if user is unable to repay their debts, they would need to pay higher debts while the the `Union` contracts are paused due incuring debts.

All of the above repay functions calls internal function `_calculatingInterest()` which will return the interest for the borrower account. `_calculatingInterest()` is implemented as:

```solidity
    function _calculatingInterest(address account) private view returns (uint256) {
        BorrowSnapshot memory loan = accountBorrows[account];

        if (loan.principal == 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        uint256 borrowRate = borrowRatePerSecond();
@>        uint256 currentTimestamp = getTimestamp();
@>        uint256 timeDelta = currentTimestamp - accrualTimestamp;   @audit // does not exclude the pause period
        uint256 simpleInterestFactor = borrowRate * timeDelta;
        uint256 borrowIndexNew = (simpleInterestFactor * borrowIndex) / WAD + borrowIndex;

        uint256 principalTimesIndex = (loan.principal + loan.interest) * borrowIndexNew;
        uint256 balance = principalTimesIndex / loan.interestIndex;

        return balance - _getBorrowed(account);
    }
```

`_calculatingInterest()` calculated interest on time difference based on `currentTimestamp - accrualTimestamp` to get the interest over the passed time period. The interest rate depends on the time passed which means higher the time passed, then the higher interest has to be paid by the users.

Therefore, when the contracts are paused the user interest is still accuring and the user has to pay unnecessary high amount than he had to pay earlier. This introduces an unnecesary risk to users by preventing them to repay their debts.

## Impact
Interest is still accuring when the `Union` contract repay is paused, it will force user to incur debts and pay higher debts than he had to earlier due to repay pause, While calculating interest, paused period is not excluded in `timeDelta` calculations so users are forced to pay higher interest.

## Recommendation
There can two solutions to mitigate the issue: 

1) Remove the `whenNotPaused` from repay functions to allow users to repay anytime irrespective of pause of contracts, OR
2) Do not consider the pause period when calculating the interest
