# BORROW_RATE_MAX_MANTISSA should be specific to chain protocol is being deployed to.

### Summary
The purpose of [BORROW_RATE_MAX_MANTISSA ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-union-finance-update-2/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/market/FixedInterestRateModel.sol#L18) is to put the protocol in failure mode when absurd utilisation makes borrowRate absurd. It is defined as a constant for all the chains. It should really be changed according to average blocktime of the chain the protocol is being deployed to.
borrowRateMaxMantissa = 0.005e16 translates to maximum borrow rate of .005% / block.
For Ethereum chain that has 12 seconds of average block time, this translates to maximum borrow rate of 0.005% * (365 * 24 * 3600)/12 = 1314. For BNB with 3 seconds of average block time it is 0.005% * (365 * 24 * 3600)/3 = 5256%. For fantom with 1 second of average block time it is 0.005% * (365 * 24 * 3600)/1 = 15768%.

### Mitigation

Decide on a maximum borrow rate protocol is ok with (my suggestion is ~1000%) and change borrowRateMaxMantissa according to what chain it is being deployed to
