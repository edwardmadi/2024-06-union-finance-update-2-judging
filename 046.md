# Lack of Access Control in `bridge()` Function of `OpConnector` Contract Allow Attackers to transfer tokens from the L1 to the L2 without permission

## Summary
The `OpConnector` contract's `bridge()` function lacks access control, allowing any external account to call it. This vulnerability can be exploited by attackers to transfer funds and disrupt the contract's intended functionality.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `bridge()` function does not restrict access to authorized accounts, which means anyone can call this function. An attacker can monitor the contract for any incoming funds or by front-running `claimTokens()`  and immediately call the `bridge()` function to transfer these funds to the L2 contract. This effectively prevents the owner from using the `claimTokens()` function to transfer L1 tokens to the intended recipient.

```solidity
function bridge() external { // @audit no access control
    uint256 amount = IERC20(l1Token).balanceOf(address(this));
    require(amount > 0, "OpConnector: Amount zero");
    uint256 currentAllowance = IERC20(l1Token).allowance(address(this), l1BridgeAddr);
```

## Impact
- **Unauthorized Fund Transfers:** Attackers can transfer tokens from the L1 to the L2 contract without permission.
- **Denial of Service:** The owner may be unable to use the `claimTokens()` function, disrupting the intended functionality of the contract.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement access control for the `bridge()` function by adding the `onlyOwner` modifier. This ensures that only the contract owner can call the `bridge()` function, preventing unauthorized access and potential attacks.
